		"content" : "How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-07-20 00:00:00",
		"content" : "As you enter the theater, there are 163 men onstage.\nNot in person, but in battalions of framed photographs staring down from the walls of an American Legion hall circa 1987.\nSoon a 15-year-old girl named Heidi arrives, with a compulsively ingratiating smile and a buttercup yellow blazer. She is there, in essence, to debate them.\nHardly seems like a fair fight, does it? It's not meant to be. Heidi Schreck's \"What the Constitution Means to Me,\" which opened on Broadway at the Helen Hayes Theater on Sunday, is nothing less than a chronicle of the legal subjugation of women by men, as experienced in the day-to-day injustices of living while female and in the foundational American document that offers paltry recourse.\nBut if \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" is nothing less than that, it is also very much more. It is a tragedy told as a comedy, a work of inspired protest, a slyly crafted piece of persuasion and a tangible contribution to the change it seeks. It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important.\nUnlike typical \"important\" plays, it doesn't announce itself as such. Rachel Hauck's diorama set, already minimal during an Off Broadway run at New York Theater Workshop last year, is a bit smaller at the Hayes. (There were 205 men Off Broadway.) The cast remains tiny. Oliver Butler's rivetingly intelligent production includes no special effects except the kind achieved by words.\nBut watch out: In a play that parses the meaning of a 230-year-old legal document, words are tricky.\n\"What the Constitution Means to Me\" even begins in deception. Addressing the audience directly, Ms. Schreck, now 47, tells and sometimes enacts the impossibly sunny story of how, as a teenager, she earned the money that would put her through college by  preaching about the Constitution at competitions around the country. In these competitions, sponsored by the American Legion, she and other entrants were asked to give seven-minute orations that drew a \"personal connection between your own life and the document\" before extemporizing on an amendment selected onstage at random.\nYoung Heidi's stock speech compared the Constitution, hilariously, to a witch's caldron. (Her chief competitor went with a patchwork quilt metaphor.) But unpacking the Ninth Amendment in her oration, and responding to the 14th in her extemporaneous challenge, Heidi often avoided making those valuable personal connections.\nWe feel the suppression. From the start, something violent and presumptively male has been threatening the complacent skin of the story. (A legionnaire played by Mike Iveson sits at the sidelines, occasionally explaining the rules but mostly just watching.) Ms. Schreck's jokes, left unrefrigerated a second too long, keep curdling after the laugh. She zooms past certain details -- such as growing up in an \"abortion-free zone\" -- as if they were haunted houses.\nThey are. And in the next part of the play, removing her jacket and reintroducing herself as a grown woman less eager to please, she lets the ghosts out. We learn about her great-great-grandmother, a melancholic mail-order bride; the history of domestic abuse in her family; and her brush with certain rights the Supreme Court eventually located in the \"penumbra\" of the Ninth Amendment and in the right to privacy of the 14th.\nBut seen now from the other side of the great achievements of the civil rights, women's rights and gay rights movements -- all of which are threatened by the same shadowy vagueness that nurtured them in the first place -- the penumbra is not a field of freedoms but a wasteland of neglect. If you are not a white, male landowner as envisioned by the founding fathers, the Constitution has little to offer you.\n\"Our bodies had been left out of the document from the beginning,\" Ms. Schreck says.\nStatements like that, out of context, may make \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" seem merely polemical, possibly misandrist and surely grim. It's none of those things. Though it is angrier and more pointed now than it was downtown, its wording clearer and its jokes finer tuned, it is also more accessible. Ms. Schreck, known as an actor before she was known as a playwright, gives a real and wrenching performance, not a speech. And Mr. Butler has shaped the play's representation of maleness -- largely through Ms. Schreck's interactions with the inventive Mr. Iveson -- with loving complexity.\nLeast of all is the play grim. Although it takes us through the classic sequence of tragedy, from hubris to recognition to horror, it doesn't bring down the curtain there. After forcing you to consider for 80 minutes whether your civics class enthusiasm for the Constitution is still defensible, Ms. Schreck then introduces a 20-minute coda that includes a live debate on the subject. (Topic: Should We Abolish the U.S. Constitution?) After a coin toss, a guest debater from a local high school takes one side and Ms. Schreck the other. An audience member judges.\nAt the performance I saw, Rosdely Ciprian, a preternaturally composed 14-year-old New Yorker, spoke for abolishment. (At alternate performances, the guest debater is Thursday Williams.) Ms. Ciprian's arguments, honed during a year of the play's development, are sophisticated and cutting, and often hilarious. But so are Ms. Schreck's. Of course, at other performances, they might wind up arguing the opposite positions.\nThat they are debating at all is an antidote to grimness. It's also an instance of theatrical activism at its purest, modeling the world the play hopes to achieve: one in which even first principles are open to vigorous, orderly debate, and in which all stakeholders, not just powerful ones, are invited to the podium.\nAfter all, Ms. Schreck points out, it would have been impossible for two women to argue policy on a public stage when the Constitution was written. They couldn't have voted until 1920. Even then, the barriers faced by Ms. Ciprian, who is Dominican-American, and Ms. Williams, who is Jamaican-American, might well have been insuperable.\nBeing underage, they can't vote now, either; some of the unexpected joy of \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" comes from the hope that people so smart and passionate and ready for change will soon be part of the electorate.\nJoy comes too from watching an imaginative new kind of theater emerge. It doesn't come from nowhere, of course: In some ways, \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" recalls Lisa Kron's memoir play \"Well,\" in which a prepared speech about urban decline is hijacked by a mother who begs to differ. In other ways, Ms. Schreck's play seems to be part of the wave of formal experimentation being led by young black playwrights today.\nLinking these works is a sense of backlash and betrayal. But in the wake of tragedy, Ms. Schreck offers something more than catharsis. \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" is one of the things we always say we want theater to be: an act of civic engagement. It restarts an argument many of us forgot we even needed to have.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-07-14 00:00:00",
		"content" : "Some plays are seeds and some are stones.\nSeeds are the ones that grow and change over the course of their stage time -- and maybe, in the minds of those who see them, forever.\nStones are the ones that always remain exactly what they are. They never expand but can still knock you out.\n\"Accidentally Brave,\" which opened on Monday, is a stone. Not just for us but also for its author, Maddie Corman, giving a riveting performance, mostly as herself. The real-life situation she has endured over the past four years, and replays eight times a week at the DR2 Theater, still hangs on her heart. It may always.\nThe \"thing\" began, as far as Ms. Corman knew, in the summer of 2015. Driving to a television soundstage in Brooklyn at 5 a.m. to tape an episode of \"a semi-terrible TV show,\" she received a frantic call from her home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. While in the background her 11-year-old twin boys cry, her 16-year-old daughter shrieks in terror. Police are there and are \"taking Dad's computer.\"\nDad was, and is, Jace Alexander, a director known for his work on \"Law & Order.\" As BuzzFeed reported, investigators who entered the couple's house that day recovered files from Mr. Alexander's devices \"that showed minors engaged in sexual acts.\"\nWhat happens when your husband of 17 years, your \"best person,\" your \"friend and confidant and true-blue love\" -- not to mention your children's father, who sings songs at the piano and listens to NPR -- turns out to be a compulsive consumer of child pornography?\n\"Accidentally Brave\" recounts Ms. Corman's shame and confusion as every prop beneath her warm, stable, suburban life gets knocked out. Nor does the emotional chaos end after Mr. Alexander completes a 45-day rehab for sex addiction and is sentenced, in 2016, to 10 years' probation. Though he was never accused of touching any child inappropriately, he must also register as a sex offender.\nAs the family transfers the twins to a new school, then relocates to a new neighborhood, all the while forced to forgo ordinary pleasures like coaching youth soccer and inviting children to trick-or-treat at their house, Ms. Corman tries to understand how the disaster happened and how she can survive it.\n\"Accidentally Brave\" does not offer answers. For one thing, Ms. Corman provides few details about Mr. Alexander. What happened to him is \"not my story to tell,\" she says. And though she breaks her rule just enough to suggest the existence of explanatory events that \"happened\" in his youth, she does not in any way attempt to inhabit him the way she inhabits herself, her children and her friends, both stalwart and fair-weather. She never even mentions his name.\nGiven her skill at investing stage characters with palpable humanity -- her daughter's scream is both bloodcurdling and heartbreaking -- this denial feels like an especially powerful expression of anger. And yet the real twist in the tale (though it's not a spoiler) is that she and Mr. Alexander remain married, and have in some ways improved their relationship through the restart forced upon them.\nThat's a development that might have been easier to understand had it been dramatized, in scenes that did not quarantine important parts of the story and that inched toward resolution in real time. I wanted to see, rather than just hear as an anecdote, how Ms. Corman came to understand her husband as someone who isn't evil but unwell, poisoned by pornography. And how she came to stand by him, as her wedding vows promised, in sickness, not just in health.\nMs. Corman, a professional actor since her teens -- and herself the victim of sexual harassment at a young age -- could certainly have performed such a script. With her nanosecond timing, she has nailed tricky ensemble scenes as both a sophisticated sidekick (in \"Next Fall\") and an artless matron (in \"The Babylon Line\"), among many others.\nHere, though, the form forces her to create an illusion of drama through a kind of solo montage. Several customized bravura sequences show her toggling with daredevil facility among various characters and moods. She smash-cuts from devastation to furor to false calm as if road testing them to see which is most useful.\nThough you can't help responding to the intensity of these acting moments, there is something slick about \"Accidentally Brave\" that comes with the confessional monologue genre. Ms. Corman may hate the word \"journeys\" but her script is not free of self-help jargon. More than once she offers the de rigueur (yet unnecessary) excuse that in telling her story she hopes \"to be of service.\"\nThe production, directed by Kristin Hanggi, seems to take its cue from the same idea, couching despair in a pastel atmosphere of hope. The projections (by Elaine J. McCarthy) and original music (by Claire Wellin) suggest a special episode of \"Oprah.\" There is even an Oprah-like character -- a \"very amazing and very famous\" person identified only as Angel -- who blows into the story from time to time to offer support and advice.\nI don't know how many people have connections to Angels. Nor do I know how many could afford the deluxe Arizona rehab that helped Ms. Corman's husband. \"Accidentally Brave\" nevertheless contends at every turn that families can survive psychological devastation and reformulate themselves on a more solid if somber basis.\nIt's nice to think so -- and for people enduring such trauma, that's undoubtedly, yes, a service.\nBut the monologue form being what it is, Ms. Corman's performance is more convincing with the negatives than with the positives. Is that because -- even absent disaster -- life is, too?\n\"Accidentally Brave\" can't help you there.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-07-07 00:00:00",
		"content" : "That was the way I felt during much of Sam Gold's production of \"King Lear,\" which opened on Thursday night with the extraordinary Glenda Jackson in the title role. It should surprise no one that Ms. Jackson is delivering a powerful and deeply perceptive performance as the most royally demented of Shakespeare's monarchs.\nBut much of what surrounds her in this glittery, haphazard production seems to be working overtime to divert attention from that performance. That includes a perfectly lovely string quartet -- playing original music by Philip Glass, no less -- that under other circumstances I would have enjoyed listening to.\nHere, though, this intermittent concert seems to be competing with, rather than underscoring, Shakespeare's bleakest tragedy. The same might be said of Miriam Buether's blindingly gold set (lighted to sear the eyes by Jane Cox), which blazes with nouveau riche vulgarity.\nPerhaps we are meant to think of the gilded surfaces of Trump pleasure domes, though I'm not sure that's the intention. To be honest, I'm not sure of a lot of the intentions behind the choices here.\nThat includes those of many of the supporting players, who include the formidable likes of Ruth Wilson, Elizabeth Marvel, Jayne Houdyshell and John Douglas Thompson. By and large, the performances seem to have been blown into uneasy coexistence by random winds from different directions.\nYet there, amid the chaos, is Ms. Jackson, like a sharp and gleaming scythe slashing through an overgrown field. Lear may be one of world literature's most disturbingly lost souls. But Ms. Jackson hews to his tortured path with such insight that we register every twisting contour in a dispossessed monarch's road into madness and redemption. That is, when the view of him isn't obstructed by the garish obstacle course that has been assembled for him to run.\nThis is the role with which Ms. Jackson, a two-time Oscar winner, returned to the stage to hosannas -- at London's Old Vic in 2016 -- after 23 years as a member of the British Parliament. Continuing what is sure to remain one of the most remarkable second -- or is it third? -- acts in show business, Ms. Jackson proceeded to Broadway in 2018 to appear not as Lear, but as the aged, bitter, death-denying central figure of Edward Albee's \"Three Tall Women.\"\nShe deservedly won the 2018 Tony Award for best actress for that performance. Now, at last, New York has the chance to see her Lear, albeit in a different production, and it is a carefully faceted jewel.\nThe surprise here isn't that a woman is playing a man, which quickly comes to seem irrelevant. What's more unexpected is the subtlety with which this natural powerhouse shades her character from the start.\nUnlike most Lears, Ms. Jackson doesn't begin in full, imperious spleen. When we first meet him, he's a tyrant who doesn't have to raise his voice because he assumes his every wish is everybody else's command. Unquestioning obedience from those who orbit him is the central fact of his life.\nWhen he exiles his youngest, best-loved daughter, Cordelia (a sullen Ms. Wilson) because she isn't sufficiently effusive in her praise of him, it feels like a petulant, conditioned reflex, the caprice of a moment that he might later reverse.\nExcept, of course, he's renounced his power, dividing his kingdom among his sycophantic older daughters, Goneril and Regan (Elizabeth Marvel and Aisling O'Sullivan, whose accents suggest they grew up in very different parts of the world).\nFrom that moment, Lear's will is no longer the world's law, a change of circumstance that dumbfounds him. Ms. Jackson turns his fall from power into a carefully graded ascent into self-knowledge. Yes, this king howls and rants and reviles, after being turned out by the daughters he assumed would always worship him.\nBut his madness is that of a cosseted egotist who has experienced an electric shock to his solipsism. Divested of home and \"the large effects that troop with majesty,\" Lear is forced to perceive the loneliness and nakedness of the human lot, and Ms. Jackson makes sure that we see him seeing it.\nOn that blasted heath, in the fabled storm of the third act (bizarrely played on the shallow ledge left by the fallen drop curtain), what registers most poignantly aren't the violent imprecations.\nIt's Lear's astonished, self-lacerating recognition of what he calls \"unaccommodated man\" as a universal condition. When Lear startlingly sees himself in a half-naked beggar (Sean Carvajal as the disguised Edgar) on the heath, Ms. Jackson's wondering, wounded expression suggests an epiphany that's both glorious and damning.\nSad to say, nothing else in this production matches her incisiveness.\nMr. Gold took brazen but rewarding liberties with Shakespeare in his excellent, starry New York productions of \"Othello\" (with Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo, in 2016) and \"Hamlet\" (with Oscar Isaac in 2017).\nPresented in intimate Off Broadway houses, these shows made the audience feel complicit with performers, who seemed to be excavating their characters and unearthing precious discoveries as we watched. Mr. Gold's \"Lear\" is filled with gimmicky stage business that hasn't been refined into a more fully integrated point of view.\nOr maybe the problem is that the cast members seem to be moving to different internal music and rhythms, so that no one appears to be in sync with anyone else. Is that Mr. Gold's point? It seems fitting that in this version, Regan's husband, the Duke of Cornwall (Russell Harvard), is deaf. Is Cornwall's aide (Michael Arden) -- who conspicuously interprets speeches into vigorous sign language -- perhaps meant to signify the difficulty of disparate souls communicating?\nOh, I don't know. Nor did I really understand why there was a life-size ceramic pug and lion by Lear's throne. Or why everyone -- including Lear's supposedly ill-kempt, rowdy soldiers -- looks like extras from \"Downton Abbey\" in their evening clothes (the illustrious Ann Roth did the costumes), forever sipping tea or Champagne, even when the world is falling apart.\n(I think I do understand why Ms. Wilson's piquant, Cockney-accented Fool, after delivering a poem about the topsy-turviness of an unhinged world, pulls up his trousers to reveal American flag socks. But it's a desperate and sour bid for relevance.)\nThe cast members at least seem to know what they're saying, although few of them (the double-cast Ms. Wilson is an exception) have taken the next step in creating complete portraits. Mr. Thompson (as the faithful Kent) and Ms. Houdyshell (as the doomed, fatuous Gloucester) and Pedro Pascal (as the dastardly Edmund) deliver clear-spoken but oddly unmodulated performances.\nMs. Marvel at least seems to have a thought-through idea for her Goneril (as a sexually overcharged society hostess). But it's hard to imagine her emerging from the same royal nursery as Ms. O'Sullivan's shrill, primal Regan.\nSuch disparities mean that the kingdom of Lear becomes a very, very lonely planet, where no one has anyone to talk to, really. Maybe that's why so many of the performers pitch their monologues directly to the audience, like stand-up comics in search of reassurance.\nThat does not include Ms. Jackson's Lear. Her monologues are delivered defiantly to the heavens, as if she had a direct line to a cruel and almighty God. On the basis of this supremely intelligent performance, I don't doubt that she does.\n",

		"content" : "A British court on Monday overruled a lower court's ruling that would have forced a mentally disabled woman to undergo an abortion 22 weeks into her pregnancy.\nThe reversal came after the mother of the woman, who's a former midwife, appealed the initial court ruling last Friday in which the judge said abortion was \"in the best interests\" of the pregnant woman.\nThe appeal court judges Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Jackson said they will disclose the reasons for overturning the decision at a later time, the Guardian reported.\nThe case of an unnamed woman, a Roman Catholic with developmental disabilities and the mental age of a 6- to 9-year-old, has galvanized the pro-life community in Britain and around the globe.\nOver 116,000 people signed a pro-life petition posted on Saturday that asked the U.S. government to intervene in the case \"to prevent this gross injustice being inflicted by the State on this family and ensure this woman is not forced to have an abortion.\"\nScottish Bishop John Keenan of the Diocese of Paisley shared the petition and warned that the ruling otherwise \"introduces a dangerous new development in the overreach of the power of the state over its citizens,\" the Catholic News Agency reported.\nBishop John Sherrington, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Westminster, said the initial ruling not only \"infringes upon her human rights\" but also \"the right of her unborn child to life in a family that has committed to caring for the child.\"\nJustice Nathalie Lieven admitted in the initial ruling that it's an \"immense intrusion\" to order the abortion against the woman's will, but argued that it's in the best interest of the woman.\n\"I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,\" the justice said. \"I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.\"\nBoth the pregnant woman, her mother, and a social worker who's looking after the woman argued in court that the pregnancy shouldn't be terminated.\nBut the judge said the woman didn't have the mental capacity to make her own decisions even it look like she wanted to continue the pregnancy.\n\"I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,\" she said, pointing out that she didn't fully comprehend what having a baby entails.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-25 04:11:48",
		"content" : "Harry and Meghan's refurb of their Frogmore Cottage home has so far cost taxpayers a whopping $3 million in U.S. dollars. The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.\nRoyal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a \"substantial overhaul\" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.\nBut the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own \"fixtures and fittings\". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.\nHarry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.\nAny work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.\nMeghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.\nRevealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: \"The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.\"\nHe added: \"The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. \"Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.\"\nA royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.\nThe main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is \"part of a five-year repainting and repair program.\" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.\nAccounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.\nThe latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a \"blatant misuse of public money\". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: \"This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.\n\"If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals.\" \"Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.\"\nThe royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the \"higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel\" and there were \"five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18\".\nCharles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.\nThis report was originally published in The Sun.\n",

		"content" : "SAN DIEGO- An expert witness called by the prosecution in the court-martial trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher told the court Monday that there is no physical or photographic evidence to prove a stabbing occurred in the death of an ISIS prisoner back in 2017. \nDr. Frank Sheridan, a forensic pathologist, told a Navy prosecutor earlier that the alleged victim's injuries were consistent with a stab wound, but later-- when questioned by Gallagher's attorney-- appeared to cast doubt on his earlier comments.\n\"There is no evidence at all that a stabbing occurred,\" said Maj. Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.\"\n",

It is tragic, and it really shouldn't happen. And kids of American criminals, they suffer here too because of the mistakes of their parents. And parents coming illegally, again tragic but now comes the consequences for the whole family sometimes. Or at least there should be consequences if the rule of law means anything,\" Ingraham told her audience.\nThe host criticized Pelosi for not taking care of American citizens first and used San Francisco as an example.\n\"Nancy doesn't need to go far, does she, from San Francisco to see suffering and desperation. We have seen all those stories. Maybe she should focus on fixing that before throwing rocks,\" Ingraham said.\nIngraham also blasted Democrats for remaining silent on the issue when former President Obama faced the same accusations.\n\"But where were the Democrats? Where were their outrage before Trump came into office?\" Ingram said before playing a clip of Obama.\n\"Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they will get sent back, more importantly, they may not make it,\" President Obama said in 2014 interview with ABC News.\nIngraham blasted the media, Democrats and Pelosi for misleading the public.\n\"Now, do any of you remember Nancy Pelosi firing off angry tweets in demanding a change in Obama policy or criticizing these allegedly inhumane conditions?\" Ingraham said.\n\"Don't be deceived by the media coverage where the motive images you are seeing because it happened years ago and the Democrats were silent.\"\n",

The people you kill when you impose sanctions are the most vulnerable in society. These are the poorest people, the sickest people.\"\nHe continued, \"So if that's his concern, he seems almost gleeful about the idea of imposing more and more sanctions on Iran.

The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.\nAbbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means \"closing channel of diplomacy forever,\" according to Reuters. \n\"Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,\" the tweet read.\nJohn Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is \"walk through that open door.\" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.\nTrump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his \"restraint\" is not limitless.\nTrump said the sanctions \"will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions \"lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.\"\nFox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.\nSources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report\n",

He started 'school refusing',\" said Mrs Webster. \nSchool refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.\nHe did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.\nNow 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.\n\"Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,\" she said. \n\"But they all turned us down. One said he would be isolated because there was no peer group for him. Another said his needs were too complex.\"\nInstead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. \nThe family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. \n\"I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,\" said Mrs Webster. \n\"It's so frustrating. It's not just his physical needs, it's emotional too. We don't want him in a noisy, pressure-filled environment.\"\nCouncillor Ruth Buttery, cabinet member for children and young people, said: \"Working in conjunction with health and education providers, we are determined to provide the best possible outcomes for pupils with Send or additional health needs and we have recently appointed two specialist education officers to support and advice parents and carers.\"\n",

They poured bleach on me.\"\nShortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.\nThe footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. \nAnother video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.\nPolice say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.\nThey were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.\nJussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.\nHe was charged with filing a false police report.\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett \"took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career\".\nA judge said the \"most vile\" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.\nSmollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.\nBut about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.\nIllinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.\nBut he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.\nThen Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision \"a whitewash of justice\".\nMr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.\nChicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. \nOn 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.\nTwo weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for \"three times\" that amount by the City of Chicago.\nIn April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.\nSmollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as \"comical\" and \"ridiculous\".\nThen, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.\nThis sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said. \n",

		"content" : "\"He brought out a knife and lunged at me,\" said Burhan, a teenager who came to the UK seeking safety.  \nBurhan - not his real name - arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry, aged 16. \nBut authorities did not believe he was a child and instead placed him into the adult system, where he says he was attacked.\nHe is one of 137 child asylum seekers - identified by Newsnight - that have been wrongly classified as adults. \nBetween January 2018 and March 2019, these children were sent into adult accommodation, only for authorities to later accept they had been telling the truth about their age. \nUsing the Freedom of Information act, Newsnight identified 26 cases in Derby, and 29 in Cardiff. Another nine were identified in Birmingham, 56 in Liverpool, eight in Croydon, seven in Wakefield and two in Glasgow. \nThese cities are the UK's seven regional hubs for processing asylum seekers.\nBurhan - whose identity Newsnight is protecting - is from a troubled area of the Middle East. \n\"I was in the lorry for three days. I had no food and only a little water, which ran out quickly,\" he said.\n\"When I got off the lorry, I went to a petrol station and asked for the police.\"\nBurhan was originally treated as a child, but then social services visited him to say they believed he was in fact 20, not 16. \n\"I said 'no - you're wrong',\" Burhan recalled. \"They said if you don't go, we will call the police and the police will take you by force.\n\"I felt so powerless because no matter how many times I explained to them, they didn't want to believe me.\"\nClassed as an adult asylum seeker, he was sent to live in a room in a house with other asylum seekers, older than him. \nIt was there, Burhan said, an older man kicked his bedroom door down and attacked him.\n\"He had a plate in his hand and he smashed it on my head,\" he said. \"My eyesight was blurry and I couldn't see. He brought out a knife... he lunged at me, but I managed to avoid it and ran away.\n\"I was very scared and I was shivering. I ran away with no clothes on, not even shoes. I only came back after the police had arrested him.\"\nIn 2018, almost 3,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers arrived in the UK claiming to be under 18. It's widely accepted that some will be adults posing as children.\nLast year, man who posed as a 15-year-old in Ipswich was thought to be as old as 30.\nIf asylum seekers are deemed to be children, they have more access to education and a better chance of being allowed to settle in the UK. \nAfter eight months, Burhan's case was reviewed by independent social care workers and it was judged that he was a child. \n\"When they said I was a child, it was mixed feelings. I was happy that finally somebody believed me but I was upset that they wasted my time and they made me feel terrible,\" Burhan said. \nHe is now learning English at college and is staying in appropriate accommodation. \nLabour Peer and former refugee Lord Dubs told Newsnight that cases such as Burhan's, when the Home Office does not believe someone is a child, are the \"harshest\".\n\"This is not helped by the fact that refugees have often been scrutinised by the media for looking older,\" he added.  \n\"We must not forget that these people have been on terrific journeys, and that they therefore probably look older given what they have endured.\" \nIn May, a case was brought before the Court of Appeal and judges ruled the process by which age was assessed was unlawful. \nNow, anyone appearing under the age of 25 will be referred to specialist local authority age assessors. \nThe Home Office said it was \"disappointed\" by this judgement. \n\"We take our duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the asylum and immigration system very seriously. However, age assessment is an extremely difficult area of work and is not an exact science,\" a Home Office spokesman said.\n\"Our approach seeks to strike an important but sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are appropriately supported whilst at the same time maintaining the integrity of the asylum system and preventing adults passing themselves off as children.\"\n",

Mayor Pete Buttigieg who has been criticized over his handling of a police officer shooting a African-American man, highlighting racial tensions in the city.\n\"Buttigieg has been a total absentee mayor and a failure,\" Hannity said. \"He's hardly ever in South Bend.\"\nHannity  warned his viewers the that Democrats have moved even further left and want to take the country in a direction beyond even what the Obama administration had wanted to.\n\"Instead of sticking to any principles real agenda real policy that will help the forgotten men and women that got destroyed under the Biden-Obama economy, the extreme left now has gone further out to the fringe pandering to every corner of the Democratic Party,\" Hannity said.\nThe host blasted candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for supporting reparations for gay Americans and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for saying he would meet with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\n\"Of course specifics aren't a priority for the new radical Democrats and they're not going to tell us how to pay for anything they'll say and do anything to try and get elected, to take away every person's fear with false promises and lies that really are about their power,\" Hannity said,\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 21:57:00",
		"content" : "Everyone knew weeks ago that the New Orleans Pelicans would claim Duke star Zion Williamson with the first pick in the NBA Draft.\nIf only we could enjoy such lucidity on Capitol Hill.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.\n\"We're close,\" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: \"I think we're further apart.\"\nThe varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.\nJust before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.\n\"We're going to get it done,\" said the source, who asked not to be identified. \"We have to.\"\nThe big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.\n\"You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\nCongressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.\n\"Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,\" McConnell said last month.\nThen came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.\nEverything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a \"cover-up\" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.\nGranted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing \"Kumbaya\" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.\nSo, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.\n\"In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,\" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. \"Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.\"\nStanding next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.\nPelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.\n\"When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,\" Pelosi said.\nThe Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.\n\"Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?\" retorted an agitated Pelosi. \"Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.\"\nThat conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.\nMulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.\n\"I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.\nOne senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney \"p---ed everybody off\" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.\nHowever, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.\nAfter the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.\n\"Everybody is trying to raise the caps,\" said Mulvaney.\nAfter the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.\n\"So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,\" said Mulvaney.\nThe Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House \"deemed\" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.\nHoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" or \"OCO.\" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.\n\"That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,\" said Hoyer. \"[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.\"\nThe lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.\nWhen asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied \"as long as we can get. As early as we can get.\"\nBut the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as \"messaging\" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.\nOne source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.\nRepublicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.\nThe downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.\nSo this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.\n",

The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives.\" \nEsper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.\nEsper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.\nEsper said Monday the department's priorities would \"remain unchanged\" and everything the department did \"should support its stated objectives.\" \nHe then went on to explain \"three mutually reinforcing lines of effort\" used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building \"a more lethal force,\" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department \"for greater performance and affordability.\"\nIn his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the \"surest way to deter adversary aggression\" and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it's important to \"continue to build readiness to fight\" while \"modernizing key capabilities for future conflict.\" \nEsper explained that U.S. allies and partners \"play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world.\" He added that through continued engagement the country will \"grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability.\" \nEsper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.\nHe served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.\nFollowing his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.\n\"Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,\" Esper wrote in the memo. \"This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive.\" \nHe encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and \"always do the right thing.\" \n\"Together, we will remain the most ready and capable military force in the world, which is what our nation expects and deserves,\" Esper said. \nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.\n",

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats.

		"content" : "Family and friends of missing Connecticut mother of five Jennifer Dulos on Monday countered a claim from her estranged husband's lawyer that the author was \"deeply troubled,\" and said any links to a book she wrote nearly two decades ago were way off base.\nIn a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was \"emotional, tired, distraught\" over the \"exhausting ordeal\" and disappearance of his estranged wife.\nHe said Jennifer Dulos \"had a troubled past,\" describing her as a writer who \"wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'\" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.\nIn response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: \"This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.\"\nShe continued, \"We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.\"\nLuft added, \"Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.\"\nJennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.\nThe couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos \"seemed intent\" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.\n\"She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,\" Pattis said.\nHowever, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was \"terrified for [her] family's safety.\" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., \"has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.\"\nLuft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.\n\"I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,\" Luft said. \"She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).\"\nShe added, \"Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.\"\nFotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.\nFotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.\nPattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.\nHe said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had \"reasons to doubt that it's reliable.\"\nPattis released a statement on Monday writing, \"We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.\"\nHe continued, \"Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.\"\nFox News' Maria Paronich, Vandana Rambaran and Perry Chiaramonte contributed to this report. \n",

		"content" : "The Mexican government has dispatched approximately 15,000 troops and National Guard officers to the U.S. border in a bid to check the flow of migration from Central America, the country's defense chief told reporters Monday.\nMexico promised earlier this month to send 6,500 National Guard agents to its southern border, but Monday's announcement was the first public acknowledgment of deployments to the U.S. border.\nAt a news conference in the Caribbean city of Cancun, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican forces were detaining migrants to prevent them from crossing the U.S. border. Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.\n\"Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,\" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.\nMexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called \"remain in Mexico\" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.\nNuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.\nPrevious rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.\n\"It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,\" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. \"The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion). We will continue knocking on doors to find resources. The municipal government is overwhelmed.\"\nRivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.\nThomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.\nThere have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n",

He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. \nDoubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.\nLueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.\nLast Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.\n\"Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,\" Doubt said on Monday. \nHe added, \"Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.\"\nDoubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. \n\"Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,\" Doubt said. \"Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything.\" \nThe University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.\n\"The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie \"Kenzie\" Lueck and her family,\" the statement said. \"The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.\"\nLueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.\n\"Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.\nThe proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.\nThe legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has \"literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.\"\nThe U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.\nFox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.\nFox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes.

The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.\nTRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS\nThe judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\n\"We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,\" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.\nShe said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, \"abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.\"\nRepublican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.\n\"We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,\" he said in a statement.\nThe fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.\nThe state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three \"failed abortions\" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.\nMissouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n",

		"content" : "The New York Mets fined manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas an undisclosed amount Monday, one day after the pair cursed out a newspaper reporter following a loss to the Chicago Cubs.\nMets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey \"regrettable on many levels.\"\n\"I think frustrations were high,\" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. \"And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.\"\nCallaway repeatedly called Healey a \"motherf---er\" after the reporter told the manager that he would \"see you tomorrow\" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would \"knock you the f--- out, bro\" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.\nIn a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.\n\"He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,\" Healey told the paper. \"I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.\"\nThe Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: \"The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.\"\n\"I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,\" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, \"and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.\"\nCallaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: \"I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.\"\nHowever, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.\n\"I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,\" Callaway said. \"It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.\"\nVargas said Monday that the issue was \"an unfortunate distraction.\"\n\"Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,\" Vargas told reporters. \"So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.\"\nThe Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n",

The mother of Damian Hurley -- an actor and budding fashion model himself -- has remained one of the industry's leading age-defying women and recently spilled the beans on how she remains in top shape.\n\"I think we have to stay active, whether it's formal exercise or just moving around a lot,\" the British model told Closer Weekly last month. \"I think we have to watch what we eat.

		"content" : "On Wednesday and Thursday nights, the top 20 (yes, 20) Democratic hopefuls will appear for the first debates of the campaign. For the current second tier, this may represent an opportunity for them to break out from a pack whose sheer size - and intense national schedule - makes this year more challenging for what we might charitably call campaign \"asterisks.\" For the front runners and top tier challengers, these nights represent real risks of a blooper that could derail any of them, or an opportunity to address - directly - issues that have been raised about them.\nThe \"card\" for each night features ten candidates for two hours - with a panel of five NBC moderators. To limit size, the moderators will tag team, so each hour will have thirteen people on stage.\nI reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:\nMy bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected \"bites.\"\nSanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum. In 2016, against Hillary Clinton, he was easily able to represent the more progressive ranks of the party. But with Warren feeding a stream of detailed progressive plans, that's harder. His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his \"Democratic Socialist\" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.\nHarris has often slipped in unscripted settings, but she continues to be formidable in fund raising. She needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.\nMy bet for both nights: While the also-rans will seek attention, their sheer volume will enable each of the top front runners to maintain their status, and the race will continue to be a five-way campaign among Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg.\n",

		"content" : "A 26-year-old man from North Carolina has been charged with murder for shooting and killing a Missouri officer who was responding to a call in North St. Louis County on Sunday, police said Monday. \nBonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. \nOfficer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. \nPolice added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.\nNorth County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.\n\"Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,\" Martin said. \nThe North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for \"one of our officers down.\" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.\nMartin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market \"a struggle ensued between both of them,\" adding that \"the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.\"\nMartin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. \n\"At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,\" Martin said. \n\"Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,\" Martin continued. \n\"Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,\" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.\nMartin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot \"gun in hand\" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.\nMartin said that when Meeks was arrested, \"he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf.\" \nOfficer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.\n\"Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,\" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.\nHe added, \"When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times.\" \n\"He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,\" Martin told reporters on Monday. \"There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day.\" \nHe added, \"I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.\"\nMartin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and \"ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.\"\n\"Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,\" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.\nPolice said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.\nAccording to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.\n\"We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,\" Martin said. \n\"It's tough to get a grasp on it all,\" he added. \nLangsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.\n\"The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,\" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.\nBuchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.\n\"Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,\" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family.\n",

And, to also draw a contrast with each other,\" Brazile said.\nClimate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or \"green\" plan to tackle the issue.\nHowever, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.\nIn May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.\nOn Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.\nThat's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.\nThe Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.\n\"Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,\" Sanders said. \"The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.\"\nRep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.\nAn impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: \"What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.\"\n\"It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,\" the New Yorker said.\nOn \"America's Newsroom,\" Brazile said Americans \"want to hear solutions\" to the issue.\"45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,\" Brazile noted.\n\"There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions.\"\n",

But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.\n\"And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.\"\nAfter losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.\nHowever, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.\nThe pair said they would often chat \"for hours\" until Andrew \"picked up the courage\" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.\nHowever, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.\n\"We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,\" said Karen.\n\"We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.\n\"He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.\n\"It couldn't have gone any better. I think if I had actually met him the day we were supposed to meet, I would have been a nervous wreck. But because it was the day before, I got surprised.\"\nAndrew proposed to Karen in June 2018 in Paris. They married on June 22, and are now on their honeymoon in Italy.\n\"I just want to say to all the women out there because careful what you wish for, because wishes do come true,\" Karen said.\n\"If you are 30, 40 or 50 and haven't found the right man yet, don't worry. You have to give it time.\"\n",

A crowd gathered as the fisherman fought to reel in the amazing catch.\nFabiana Pons captured the scene on video and uploaded it to the internet. The footage shows the man struggling to control the large animal while others try to measure the beast. It has not been stated what type of shark it was, although based on the footage, it wasn't a happy kind of shark.\nAfter showing off the catch, the fisherman released the shark back into the ocean.\nThis isn't the first shark to be sighted on the New Jersey coastline recently. Last week, a group of fisherman had a shocking encounter with a much larger shark in the waters off of New Jersey.\nThe group of five men was wrapping up after a day of fishing when they spotted the massive animal. It circled the boat several times before charging up and grabbing their chum bag with its mouth. This incident was also caught on camera and drew several comparisons to the 1975 movie \"Jaws.\"\n",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are trying to outdo each other with their campaign promises, according to Chris Stirewalt.\nSanders and Warren are both staking their claim in the progressive wing of the 2020 primary field, and beginning to cause concern among party brass, Stirewalt said Monday on \"The Daily Briefing.\"\n\"By the time Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are done, they will be promising each and every American a new Buick LaCrosse in their parking lot,\" the Fox News politics editor claimed.\n\"They are in this lunatic derby. This is why Democratic leaders are rightly afraid of what's going on. Because, if Sanders - who is now promising to forgive the student loans of everybody, basically, 'throw in another trillion dollars,' - if either Sanders or Warren get the nomination, there is a reality that Democrats won't just miss out on taking the White House back, but they could get cleaned out in the Senate.\"\nStirewalt claimed there is a danger the two candidates' platforms could cause Democrats to also lose control of the House.\n\"This stuff is way outside the mainstream,\" he claimed. \"That's what Democrats are afraid of.\"\nDuring a speech Saturday at Clinton College in Rock Hill, S.C., Sanders claimed graduates are put in an \"absurd position of having to pay that debt off for decades.\"\n\"Some of those people, they can't afford to get married,\" he said, in a clip played by host Dana Perino.\n\"They can afford to have kids.

		"content" : "Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claimed a \"violation of status\" was not a valid reason to deport illegal immigrants, during a Speaker of the House discussion on Monday.\nPelosi said she was uncertain of President Trump's plan to fix America's immigration system, but claimed being in the country illegally was not grounds for deportation.\n\"So, that is really kind of what happened. [Trump] didn't say what he was going to do but, as the president said, 'oh, I'll let you know, I'll let you know.' [He] went into -- 'well, people broke the laws.' A violation of status is not a reason for deportation. That's just not so,\" she said.\nAn ICE official who spoke with Fox News did not address Pelosi's comments directly but pointed to 8 U.S. Code Section 1325 (and 1326 for re-entry), and said anyone found to have violated U.S. immigration laws may be arrested, detained and - if found removable by final order - removed from the United States.\nPelosi also spoke about Trump's proposed ICE raids, which have now been delayed for two weeks to, he said, give Congress additional time to find a solution to the southern border crisis. She called the operation uncivilized and questioned its purpose.\n\"When I saw that the president was going to have these raids--I mean it was so appalling; it's outside the circle of civilized human behavior to just be kicking down doors, splitting up families, and the rest of that, in addition to the injustices that are happening at the border,\" she said.\nPelosi claimed legislation was in the works to address the immigration crisis but said there's no point in enforcing existing law within the boundaries of the United States.\n\"We have legislation to go forward to address those needs, but in terms of interior enforcement, what is- what's the point?\" she added. \"Well, I won't even go into what the motivation might be for that here because this is not a political event.\"\n",

This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.\nPrinted by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col.

The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.\n\"The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,\" said Kinyon in a statement. \"Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.\"\n\"We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,\" said Dr. R.

Every time I wake up and realize I'm back in a depressive episode, I'm bummed.\"\nHalsey, whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, said she was diagnosed as bipolar at age 17 following a suicide attempt. However, she says she now embraces who she is and everything her diagnosis comes with -- even if her mental state makes her more explosive and prone to doing \"crazy s---.\"\nAfter \"getting cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times\" and splitting with rapper G-Eazy for good, Halsey has a much clearer conscience and has seemed to find her purpose. She managed to stay atop the charts for 12 consecutive weeks with \"Closer,\" her collaboration with the Chainsmokers -- and also landed her a first number one solo single with \"Without Me,\" an ode to her breakup with the Bay Area emcee. \nIn the lengthy artist profile, the \"Ghost\" performer who has been an advocate for survivors of sexual abuse said she recently confronted her abuser. The multiplatinum artist said the person who allegedly abused her \"took it seriously, went to rehab, sought therapy.\" \nWhile she is glad she is now able to speak out about her difficult past, Halsey refuses to be categorized as a victim. \"I have worked way too f---ing hard to be quantified or categorized by something like that,\" she said.  \"Then I'm not 'Grammy-nominated pop star,' then I'm 'rape survivor,'\" she said with a tremor. \n\"Uh-uh, no. Absolutely not,\" she added.\nHalsey admitted that she had been in a dark place during her journey and said she has made massive changes in her life to correct the negative imbalances she carried.

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 15:43:55",
		"content" : "The Dominican public health minister said in a radio interview Monday that the Maryland couple found dead last month in a hotel room at a luxury resort had pre-existing health problems and may have died after mixing prescription drugs and alcohol.\nIn response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim \"absolutely ludicrous.\"\nPublic Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost \"simultaneously\" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.\n\"The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,\" Sanchez Cardenas said. \"There's been talk about drug abuse,\" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that \"they had pre-existing health issues.\"\nSanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.\n\"Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,\" he said. \"Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.\"\nIn a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \nEdward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.\nSeveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\nAutopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\nFBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\nThe news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\nMany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.\nThe FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.\nAmong the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\nAs Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.\nDominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\nIn the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.\nSuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\nSuero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\nAt the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.\n\"It's a mystery,\" Bullock told WTOP. \"There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\nBullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\n\"We need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.\nSanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\nAllen's family has disputed those conclusions.\nThe health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.\nHer son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.\n\"We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,\" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. \"A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack.\"\n",

		"content" : "A former University of Illinois doctoral student was convicted Monday of killing a visiting scholar from China after abducting her at a bus stop as she headed to sign an off-campus apartment lease.\nJurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.\nThe swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.\nProsecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.\nJurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.\nThere are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.\nZhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n",

De Blasio is schduled to partake in the first of two-night NBC debate on Wednesday.\n\"Hey Dad, I'm glad you asked.

Tell them the story of how you met mom... weave it into a reflection about how hard it is to find, like, 'the one' on tinder.\"\nThe mayor wasn't impressed with his son's initial advice and informed him that he's looking for a universal message.\n\"Ah, ok,\" Dante responded. Well, in a time of unprecedented national division, one thing we can all agree on are dogs. You're going to want to build your platform and performance around them.\"\nDante then told his father to bring photos or even a litter of puppies to the debate stage.\n\"That is definitely a creative approach... but how about something that allows me to stand out by talking about my accomplishments? I need to impress the American people,\" de Blasio told his son.\nDante told his father to tell people that New York City was \"just Staten Island\" when he started his first term.\nThe conversation continued with the mayor asking his son how to make his presence felt on the stage. Dante tells his father to \"leap over the moderator\" to dunk a basketball before they express love for each other.\nThe conversation was quickly mocked, with many people responding that he should fix the subways in New York City before worrying about a presidential bid.\n\"De Blasio's son Dante tells him to reference Tinder in Wednesday's debate in these totally real and definitely not staged texts,\" New York Daily News reporter Anna Sanders tweeted.\nCNN's Ana Navarro asked if it was a parody account, while New York Post reporter Jon Levine sarcastically wrote, \"Just totally normal dad-son banter here.\"\n",

		"content" : "When Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson isn't leaping from buildings or beating up bad guys in his blockbuster films, he's spending lots of quality time being a parent.\nThe legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film \"Hobbs and Shaw\" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.\nOne such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.\nThe actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were \"flattering to my complexion.\"\nA similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the \"Jumanji\" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.\n\"Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.\"\nSome Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, \"Let me know if you need a contractor's help!\"\nThe \"Fast and Furious\" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a \"good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.\"\nAside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.\nPerhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an \"amazing philosophical conversation\" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.\n\"I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'\" Johnson posted. \"She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.\"\nAside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.\nLast month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. \"I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,\" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.\nJohnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be \"the anchor of our blessed family.\"\n\"If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,\" Johnson wrote. \"As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love.\"\n",

		"content" : "A KFC owner in Australia's Outback is petitioning for a Michelin Star, believing his fast food franchise worthy of the high accolade.\nSam Edelman, 37, who owns a KFC outpost in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, wants it to be \"recognized as not just a fast food place,\" he said to Metro, despite the fact that the Michelin Guide does not publish in Australia.\n\"We use fresh chickens that are delivered into the store every day and hand breaded in our kitchen by our cooks. There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\n",

		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 14:32:13",
		"content" : "Alexander Skarsgard opened up about working on some intense abusive and sexual scenes with \"Big Little Lies\" co-star Nicole Kidman.\nFor better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.\nSpeaking on KISS FM's \"Kyle and Jackie O Show\" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.\n\"I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.\"\nHe revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.\n\"Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,\" he revealed. \"She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.\"\nHe even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.\nThe scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.\n\"He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,\" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 14:08:40",
		"content" : "After legalizing marijuana in 2015, officials in Oregon began liberally doling out licenses to growers in an effort to shift sales away from the black market toward the now-legalized industry. \nThe plan worked, but created another problem: Oregon now has way more pot than its 4 million residents can ever possibly hope to smoke. \nAccording to a 2019 Oregon Liquor Control Commission report, there are about 2,100 grower licensees in the state with enough weed currently on the market that it would take an estimated 6.5 years to sell it all within Oregon without any more production. The glut of marijuana has driven the price of marijuana down and left Oregonians wondering how they'll handle the weed windfall. \nIn an attempt to remedy the state's cannabis conundrum, lawmakers in Oregon signed off on two news bills in the last week that would, respectively, cut down on excessive cultivation of marijuana and find new markets for the state's budding pot industry. \nSenate Bill 218 hands the Oregon Liquor Control Board more authority in issuing new licenses to growers based on the supply and demand for weed, while Senate Bill 582 lays the groundwork to eventually allow the governor to enter into agreements with other states for the importing and exporting of marijuana. \nIt is currently illegal to transport marijuana across state borders so any moves from the governor's mansion in Salem would have to wait until lawmakers in Washington D.C. decide to make drastic changes to the nation's drug laws - a situation that seems unlikely given the Trump administration's less-than-friendly stance toward legal marijuana.\nCurrently recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and medical marijuana is legal in 33, and marijuana advocates argue that states like Oregon wouldn't be running into this surplus issue if the substance were permitted to be shipped out of state.\n\"You have people using water in the desert in Nevada to grow mediocre cannabis, or in Florida, where they have to dehumidify giant spaces, consuming twice the energy,\" Adam J. Smith, founder and director of the Craft Cannabis Alliance based in Oregon, told the Los Angeles Times. \"Oregon wouldn't have an oversupply problem if we could access legal markets like these.\"\n",

It took the entire care team to hold Michael,\" Yasmeen Bachir, a clinical nurse who helped care for Truitt, said in the blog post, which also stated that Truitt was \"dead for 20 minutes\" prior to resuscitation.\nTruitt had been working with his stepdad at a home in Livonia when a metal ladder he was carrying touched a live electrical wire. He said he doesn't remember anything past that, but the homeowner called 911 and started CPR. It took about four minutes for paramedics to arrive and they attempted to revive him with the defibrillator while en route to the hospital, but he never regained a heartbeat in the ambulance.\n\"In less than five minutes, brain cells start to die from lack of oxygen,\" Barbara Smith, the director of trauma services at Beaumont, told the hospital blog. \"Michael's resuscitation is miraculous. He did not lose any brain function. It's a testament to the importance of immediate continuous CPR to move oxygenated blood to the brain.\"\nThe only lasting injury Pruitt has from the ordeal is in his toes, where the voltage electricity exited through his body, the website said.\n",

The American beat Spain 2-1.\nThe U.S. allowed their first goal of the Women's World Cup - and the first goal since April - in the ninth minute of the match when Jennifer Hermoso scored a lobbed kick over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. The U.S. had scored 18 straight goals in the World Cup before Hermoso's kick into the back of the net.\nThe U.S. win was the team's most challenging match up yet at the World Cup after flying past Thailand, Chile, and Sweden in the group stage. The team went up against a very physical Spanish team that committed 18 fouls against the U.S. and only received one yellow card. By comparison, the U.S. only committed four fouls and got one booking against Rapinoe.\nHowever, two of the fouls proved to be detrimental as they occurred in the penalty box, giving the Americans ample opportunity to score against goalkeeper Sandra Panos.\nThe U.S. faces World Cup host France in the next round.

We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.\"\nClegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created \"the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\"\nCarole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.\n\"So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done.

Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.\nDavid Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.\n\"Horse manure,\" Lammy wrote on Twitter. \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?\"\nCollins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.\nFacebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 13:24:52",
		"content" : "Four years after President Obama proposed making community college tuition-free, free college proposals are all the rage among the Democratic presidential candidates. From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.\nThe logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.\nThe argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.\nTherefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.\nAlthough the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.\nFree college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.\nYes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.\nAccording to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.\nA challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.\nDoubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.\nA second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.\nAlthough college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.\nThe way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.\nThese disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.\nFor example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.\nInstead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, \"Choosing College,\" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.\nPolicymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.\nCollege will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment.\n",

		"content" : "Unable to send disease fighters to help battle one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history, U.S. health officials are turning to basketball hall of famer Dikembe Mutombo for help.\nMutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Monday on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.\nMore than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.\nRebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.\nMutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.\n\"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,\" he said.\n\"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,\" he said. \"I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.\"\nThe idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.\n\"We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,\" Redfield said.\nMutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.\nThe new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala. They talk about recognizing the early signs of Ebola, early treatment and prevention measures.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 12:40:05",
		"content" : "President Trump's two Supreme Court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were on opposing sides once again Monday in a case centering on whether a law that slaps harsher penalties on certain gun possession cases is unconstitutionally vague.\nGorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence,\" which is defined as a felony \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.\n\"Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,\" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.\nIn the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be \"crimes of violence.\" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.\nThe Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.\nThe government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.\nKavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.\n\"The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).\"\nKavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.\n\"Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?\" he asked, calling this a \"gaping hole\" in the majority's analysis.\nThis case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.\nGorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.\n",

The company has teamed up with another startup named Arrival that has been developing an electric delivery van.\nCharge's coupe mixes an officially-licensed aftermarket body with a 64 kilowatt-hour battery pack and four electric motors that put out a muscle car-like combined 469 hp and 885 lb-ft of torque.\nCharge claims the all-wheel-drive car will be able to accelerate to 60 mph in under four seconds and cover 200 miles per charge. You can also switch it to rear wheel drive if burnouts and drifting are more your thing.\nThe interior features a modern take on the Mustang's iconic twin-brow dashboard, and has a digital instrument cluster along with large portrait-style infotainment screen hanging down between the seats above empty space where a transmission tunnel would normally be.\nWhat it doesn't have is a pony-car style price. The high-tech creation is listed for the equivalent of $380,000, although it isn't currently available in the U.S.\nThat seems to be the going price for retro-electric Mustangs, however.

		"title" : "'Catfish' star Nev Schulman shares his advice to avoid getting tricked by online frauds",
		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 12:29:43",
		"content" : "Nev Schulman was famously duped by someone pretending to be someone else in the documentary \"Catfish.\" Now, he travels the country helping people avoid the same fate when it comes to meeting strangers online.\nSchulman, 34, hosts the MTV series \"Catfish\" in which he investigates the stories of people who believe they are getting \"catfished\" by a nefarious, or lonely, person hiding behind a curtain of lies. Sometimes the stories end in heartbreak, but some end with genuine human connections. However, speaking to Fox News, Schulman made it clear that the one thing they all have in common is that they're all shocking in some way.\n\"It's interesting, I have made, I think now over 140 episodes of the show, and not any two have been alike. They've been similar in certain ways but there's always some unforeseeable, unpredictable twist that finds its way into the story whether it's at the beginning, middle or end,\" Schulman said. \"This last season that's airing now is no different. I think as the internet continues to evolve, and as we continue to figure out how we interact with it and use it and explore it, new stuff just keeps coming up.\"\nIt's safe to say that, after more than 140 investigations and having once been the victim of a catfish himself, Schulman is an expert on sussing out frauds. Although he says social interactions are changing as quickly as technology is developing, there are some patterns that remain the same.\n\"It's funny, the nature of the relationships I see on 'Catfish' are all very specific. It's people who, for the most part, met as friends. Once in a while, it will start in a dating app, but usually it's unsuspecting,\" he explained. \"You're online, you get a 'friend request' from someone you don't really know, but you have some mutual friends so you say 'sure.' Then they start acting very friendly and you become enamored by them and flirtation leads to the next thing and before you know it, you're in a relationship.\"\nSchulman stops short of equating getting catfished exclusively with online dating because he's seen these deep  \"relationships\" develop out of friendship or an innocuous non-romantic conversation countless times. However, when it comes to ways to avoid getting catfished in 2019, the host says the basics haven't changed.\n\"Obviously you can get lied to or have a bad date. But the trouble is when you invest too much of yourself into a relationship that you haven't met,\" he explained. \"I would say the trend, or if people are going to online date, just know that if you're talking to someone for maybe, I don't know, a couple weeks, barring any strange circumstances like travel or work and they can't meet up with you... Something is probably off, and that's what you have to look out for.\"\nSchulman hosts a new crop of episodes debuting in June on MTV. Although he's going without his longtime co-host Max Joseph, who left the show in 2018, he's excited to get back out there and help some people.\n\"I am excited about this season of 'Catfish' for a lot of reasons. We went to some wild new places, we had things that have never happened happen to us and I have a bunch of really great co-hosts this season. Some you've seen before, some you haven't, who just bring incredible fresh energy to the show and we had a lot of fun. So, I think I want people to watch the show because there's a lot of TV you can watch that might not change the way you think about yourself, but our show pushes people to change the way they talk about one another in many ways.\" \n\n",

		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 12:22:31",
		"content" : "At least 10 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States and the number is growing daily.\nIn an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.\nUnlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.\nIn short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!\nAs recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.\nIf this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\nBefore the \"why\" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.\nMr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.\nAccording to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.\nAgain, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.\nAt first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.\nIn fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.\nNow that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer \"why\" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.\nHis actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.\nThe American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security.\n",

		"subtitle" : null,
		"publish_date" : "2019-06-24 12:08:01",
		"content" : "Once upon a time, Western Australia was covered in forests and those forests were filled with sightless, eyeless, tip-tapping critters called schizomids. But over the course of the last 66 million years, the region grew much hotter and drier as the whole continent shifted north toward the equator. Those forests slowly died, and the creatures within them had to find new homes. So they fled underground in many waves, evolving to survive in their radically changed environments.\nThat's the story told in a new paper based on a genetic study of those strange arachnids. The critters, very distant cousins of spiders and scorpions, are found all over the world. But only in Western Australia's Pilbara region do they turn up underground. The researchers describe 56 newfound species in their study, an incredibly diverse group for such a small area.\n\"We think there are likely to be a lot more species out there, because they have such small distributions ... and we've only been able to sample a few places,\" lead researcher Kym Abrams, a biologist at The University of Western Australia, said in a statement. [Goliath Birdeater: Images of a Colossal Spider]\nUsually, when researchers run across previously unknown subterranean schizomids, she said, it's during an environmental survey of the sort typically conducted before major construction projects.\nThat diversity of these species, Abrams and her team wrote in the paper, likely resulted from how splintered the species became as the region dried out. Eyeless schizomids are blind, and so they use their long forelegs to tap around their environments, almost like someone using a cane. And individual species all over the world tend to occupy relatively small areas.\nBut as Australia's dried-out west forced these Pilbara critters underground, the arachnids appear to have become even more isolated from one another, separated by long stretches of cooked land. And once isolated, each cluster of schizomids was free to evolve along its own path, a bit like if they'd each been dropped on different Pacific islands.\nBiologists had long wondered, the team wrote, whether Australian subterranean schizomids had all descended from a single species that traveled below the surface all at once, or whether the creatures dropped into the dirty depths in waves. This research, the scientists wrote, suggests that even though all 56 species behave similarly -- all but one type live their entire lives underground, never emerging to the surface where their ancestors lived -- they're descended from different waves of subterranean pioneers.\nOnce underground, the descendants of those pioneers got further separated from one another, evolving separately into an even wider variety of species.\nThis research was published online as part of the upcoming October issue of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\n",

Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.\n\"Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,\" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. \"We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.\"\nThe lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.\n\"Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,\" she said.\nAccording to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he \"wasn't going to turn them in\" himself.\n\"I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,\" she told police, according to Fox 13.\nBut the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: \"So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?\"\nPolice then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.\nAn arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.\nIrby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.\n\"Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,\" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. \"In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.\"\nLakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to \"safeguard every citizen's rights.\n\"When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,\" he said.\nFox News' Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.\n",

With the United States needing a tougher posture against Iran and confronting renewed challenges in Asia and Europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure America has the carriers it needs.\nThe requirement to maintain carrier presence in the Middle East is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which U.S. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.\nIndeed, the Navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the Cold War, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.\nDuring the Obama administration, a \"rebalance\" supposedly allowed the Pentagon to focus on Asia and Europe while washing its hands of the Middle East. In reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the Asia-Pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the Middle East.\nNow with a growing Iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nThis also places Tehran's proxies on the borders of key U.S. allies. Beginning next year, Tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as U.N. arms embargoes expire. It is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.\nThe Trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent Tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.\nCredible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for American policymakers.\nLast month's intelligence suggesting Iran was ready to move against U.S. interests in the Middle East demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden Iran. Responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group into the region has dramatically increased the U.S. force posture. Effective deterrence of Iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.\nA combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.\nMost fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in U.S. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission late last year.\nAt minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. The decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman two decades early.\nBut only sustained political will from both the administration and Congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the \"Navy the Nation Needs.\"\nWorking with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.\nThese changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.\nIn the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.\nCurrently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.\nThe will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.\nAmerican policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. The U.S. Navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability.\n",

		"content" : "Comedian George Lopez took a shot at President Donald Trump's immigration policy calling his children, including 13-year-old Barron, \"anchor babies.\"\nLopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.\nLopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as \"anchor baby\" and the mothers as \"immigrant.\"\n\"Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,\" Lopez captioned the meme.\n\"Anchor baby\" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\nTrump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.\nIn addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.\nThe post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.\n\"Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!\" Lopez shot back.\n",

		"content" : "Before Yoli Lara became Playboy's newest Playmate for June 2019, she was faced with Hurricane Maria.\nThe model who is originally from Toa Baja, on the outskirts of San Juan, Puerto Rico, immediately left behind her home in Los Angeles and her career to be by her family's side in 2017, when the devastating natural disaster hit the island with catastrophic results. She remained there as the island attempted to recover, as well as worked with Waves for Water, a nonprofit organization that installed handmade water filters throughout Puerto Rico.\nWilling to pick up where she left off, Lara came back to Los Angeles in 2018. And two weeks after that, Playboy called. She would go on to return to Puerto Rico once more for an opportunity of a lifetime.\nLara spoke to Fox News about baring nearly all for the magazine, why she thinks the title of Playmate is inspiring, and how Hurricane Maria impacted her home.\nAll I could think about was going home and just being with my family. I know that jeopardized my career because I was already established, signed and working in Los Angeles. But I took a chance to help my people to make them feel like we had each other's back no matter what. When I did decide to make the jump and move back home, I felt like I was doing the right thing. I knew it was going to affect my career, but I also knew in my heart that's what I was meant to do.\n",

		"content" : "The U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as President Trump nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone, officials confirmed to Fox News. \nSources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.\nFox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. \nYahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. \n\"I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,\" he tweeted at the time.\nYet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. \n\"Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,\" John Bolton said. \"No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East.\" \nWith the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. \nFor its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. \nAmid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.\nThe drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. \nIn recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.\nAt the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.\nWarships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets. \n",

They claimed that they had checked everything but clearly that was not the case,\" assistant commissioner Muthuvel Pandi said.\nIn video of the fall, the riders are seen on two platforms being hoisted into the air. However, once the ride finishes and the platforms are lowered back to the ground, the steel cables holding one of the platforms snaps and those strapped to it crash to the ground.\nThe extent of the riders' injuries was not reported.\nAccording to police, they did not find out of the incident until the footage went viral on social media, noting no one from the park came forward to file a complaint.\n\"We came to know after the video of the accident reached us. The amusement park tried to hide the whole thing and we believe they convinced the visitors who were in the ride to strike a compromise. All first aid was done there without any external interference,\" Pandi told the outlet.\nPolice contacted the park with a notice demanding the theme park shut down until they obtained legal documents to prove each of the rides are in safe workings order.\nFox News contacted Queensland Amusement Park for comment.\n",

		"content" : "Researchers have developed a new tool that could be a crucial part of the fight against deepfakes.\nThe tool, which was produced by researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute, can detect subtle face and head movements along with unique artifacts in video files, and apparently can identify such fakes with up to 96 percent accuracy.\nDeepfakes, even amateurish ones like the widely circulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that was slowed down to make her appear drunk or senile, have become a growing concern and prompted a backlash against Big Tech for not doing enough to crack down on them.\nMost deepfake detection models look at videos on a frame-by-frame basis to determine if they've been manipulated. However, the USC researchers review an entire video all at once and examine potential inconsistencies in how the subject in the footage moves -- which the researchers refer to as \"softbiometric signatures\" in their published work.\n\"To contend with this growing threat, we describe a forensic technique that models facial expressions and movements that typify an individual's speaking pattern. Although not visually apparent, these correlations are often violated by the nature of how deep-fake videos are created and can, therefore, be used for authentication,\" the researchers write in the study's abstract.\nThe scientists used a data set of about 1,000 manipulated videos to train its tool, which became adept at figuring out deepfakes of leading politicians and celebrities.\nThe issue of what do about deepfakes won't be going away anytime soon. Scientists last week revealed a software tool that literally allows you to put words into someone else's mouth.\n",

The Hatch Act is a federal law that limits certain political activities of federal employees.\nSpeaking on \"Fox & Friends,\" Conway said that, according to White House counsel, it is unclear legally whether the Hatch Act \"applies to assistants to the president.\"\n\"We think I would be the first member of the West Wing to ever be hauled in front of Congress to talk about the Hatch Act,\" she said, questioning whether her TV appearances and social media activity would fall under the Hatch Act.\n\"You know what they're mad about?

		"content" : "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to \"stand down\" on the operation.\nA source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the \"Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.\"\nThe source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\n\"He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told Fox News. \"He has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\nOn Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.\nTom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on \"Fox & Friends\" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.\n\"You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,\" Homan said. \"He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.\"\nHe noted that the leaked story \"gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets\" and added: \"This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\nThe source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\n\"To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,\" the source told Fox News, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.\"\nSources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.\nRepresentatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.\nFollowing the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that \"due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\"\nICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants \"who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.\"\nBy Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.\nThe change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would \"begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\"\nOn Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would \"give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.\"\nHe added: \"I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.\"\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \n",

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.\nDocumentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel \"candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night\" but he disagrees because \"news cycle lasts more than a day\" and Trump could do something himself to distract.\nThe MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\n\"I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*\" Hayes tweeted.\nAvirgan fired back, \"I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.\"\nHayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.\nIt's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.\nHayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.\n\"If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,\" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.\nBut the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.\n\"@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,\" the memorial tweeted.\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n",
