that slaps harsher penalties on certain gun possession cases is unconstitutionally vague.\ngorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in united states v. davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. the law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence,\" which is defined as a felony \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" that definition is rather confusing, gorsuch said.\n\"even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,\" he wrote. vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, gorsuch said, when it is really congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.\nin the current case, maurice davis and andre glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the hobbs act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. they were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be \"crimes of violence.\" an appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.\nthe supreme court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. in those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.\nthe government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.\nkavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. he warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.\n\"the court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,\" kavanaugh wrote. \"the court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than congress specified when enacting ss924(c).\"\nkavanaugh addressed the two recent cases gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. the law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. as a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.\n\"why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?\" he asked, calling this a \"gaping hole\" in the majority's analysis.\nthis case is the latest in several this term where kavanaugh and gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.\ngorsuch sided in may with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a native american man convicted for hunting in a national forest. kavanaugh opposed the ruling. a week earlier, kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that apple could be sued by iphone owners over high prices in their app store.

further defiance of our laws.\nunlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ice in 2015 under the obama administration which flew under the radar.\nin short, this operation was exactly what both democratic and republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. it was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!\nas recently reported in the washington examiner, acting department of homeland security (dhs) secretary kevin mcaleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the washington post just prior to the operation's start date.\nif this is true, then mr. mcaleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of president trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection (cbp).\nbefore the \"why\" question can be answered, you must know who mr. mcaleenan really is.\nmr. mcaleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out president trump's immigration agenda.  he has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.\naccording to jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies, mr. mcaleenan was an outspoken proponent of hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election. also, prior to 2010, mr. mcaleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the democratic party as well as democratic candidates.  according to the fec records i've seen, he has never donated to the republican party or a republican candidate.\nagain, i will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. in fact, i consider a number of democratic politicians my friends. but political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. mr. mcaleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.\nat first glance, mr. mcaleenan's bio as cbp commissioner looks very impressive. but upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.\nin fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, mr. mcaleenan has been an utter failure. notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in april of 2015, mr. mcaleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted cbp in keeping the numbers low. instead, mr. mcaleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the united states has ever seen. his job performance has been completely unacceptable.\nnow that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer \"why\" he would stymie an ice operation that had the potential to do so much good. by definition, kevin mcaleenan should be considered anti-trump.\nhis actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and president trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  and while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.\nthe american public

middle east.\nfor eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. with the united states needing a tougher posture against iran and confronting renewed challenges in asia and europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure america has the carriers it needs.\nthe requirement to maintain carrier presence in the middle east is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which u.s. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.\nindeed, the navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the cold war, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.\nduring the obama administration, a \"rebalance\" supposedly allowed the pentagon to focus on asia and europe while washing its hands of the middle east. in reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the asia-pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the middle east.\nnow with a growing iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the pacific, atlantic and mediterranean.\nthis also places tehran's proxies on the borders of key u.s. allies. beginning next year, tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as u.n. arms embargoes expire. it is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.\nthe trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.\ncredible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for american policymakers.\nlast month's intelligence suggesting iran was ready to move against u.s. interests in the middle east demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden iran. responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the abraham lincoln carrier strike group into the region has dramatically increased the u.s. force posture. effective deterrence of iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.\na combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.\nmost fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in u.s. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan national defense strategy commission late last year.\nat minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. the decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the uss harry s. truman two decades early.\nbut only sustained political will from both the administration and congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the \"navy the nation needs.\"\nworking with the navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.\nthese changes would help address shortcomings in america's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against iran. but they would not be felt for some time, while tehran is already lashing out.\nin the shorter term, the united states could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the mediterranean, the middle east and the pacific.\ncurrently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported navy ships between spain and japan; while very useful against iran, alone they offer little deterrence. coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.\nthe will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the united states has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the u.s. navy's fleet. the result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the middle east for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.\namerican policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. the u.s. navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability.",

pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.\nin may, 2020 hopeful julian castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.\nsen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.\non monday morning in front of the capitol's steps, sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.\nthat's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million americans.\nthe democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on wall street.\n\"our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on wall street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,\" sanders said. \"the american people bailed out wall street. now it is time for wall street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.\"\nrep ilhan omar, d-minn, and alexandria ocasio cortez, d-n.y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.\nan impassioned ocasio-cortez told reporters: \"what we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. you are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. you are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. but, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.\"\n\"it was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in american history elected to congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,\" the new yorker said.\non \"america's newsroom,\" brazile said americans \"want to hear solutions\" to the issue.\"45 million americans have enormous college debt. the question is, will bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? bernie sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...elizabeth warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,\" brazile noted.\n\"there's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million americans are suffering right now. they want to hear solutions.\"", "abs_lastname": "warren",

couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \nedward holmes, 63, and cynthia day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the grand bahia principe la romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. the couple, who had been at the resort since may 25, had plans to return to the united states the day they turned up dead.\nseveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, dominican officials said at a news conference last friday. autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. among nearly a dozen u.s. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\nautopsies for day and holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. day was said to have fluid in the brain. on the radio show, the health minister said that holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\nfbi officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a pennsylvania woman, miranda schaup-werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. schaup-werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\nthe news of holmes' and day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other u.s. tourists who died in other dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\nmany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the dominican republic. they have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the u.s.\nthe fbi told fox news last week that the bureau sent a team to the dominican republic to help investigate the deaths.\namong the questions that relatives and some u.s. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\nas sanchez cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview monday morning, friends and family of cynthia day were gathering at the first baptist church of glenarden in maryland for her memorial service. holmes' funeral has been scheduled for wednesday.\ndominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where day and holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\nin the morning radio interview, sanchez cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. last week, carlos suero, the spokesman for the ministry of public health, told fox news in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the dominican republic.\nsuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that sanchez cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\nsuero told fox news that holmes died first and cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\nat the funeral service, bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of day and holmes.\n\"it's a mystery,\" bullock told wtop. \"there's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\nbullock said he was focused on getting more information from u.s. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\n\"we need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said meshonn madison, day's friend.\nsanchez cardenas also singled out the deaths of joseph allen, 55, of new jersey, and leyla cox, 53, of new york. he said allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. he was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\nallen's family has disputed those conclusions.\nthe health minister said cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. however, her family and her former supervisor at the new york hospital where she worked as an mri technician said cox had never suffered a heart attack.\nher son, will cox, lashed out at dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. with the intervention of the u.s. embassy and congressional lawmakers, cox succeeded in getting dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the u.s., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.\n\"we're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,\" the health minister said of leyla cox in the radio

cases can be explained. the autopsies show what happened.\"\nin a text message sent to fox news, steven bullock, the attorney representing the maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \nedward holmes, 63, and cynthia day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the grand bahia principe la romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. the couple, who had been at the resort since may 25, had plans to return to the united states the day they turned up dead.\nseveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, dominican officials said at a news conference last friday. autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. among nearly a dozen u.s. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\nautopsies for day and holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. day was said to have fluid in the brain. on the radio show, the health minister said that holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\nfbi officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a pennsylvania woman, miranda schaup-werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. schaup-werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\nthe news of holmes' and day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other u.s. tourists who died in other dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\nmany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the dominican republic. they have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the u.s.\nthe fbi told fox news last week that the bureau sent a team to the dominican republic to help investigate the deaths.\namong the questions that relatives and some u.s. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\nas sanchez cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview monday morning, friends and family of cynthia day were gathering at the first baptist church of glenarden in maryland for her memorial service. holmes' funeral has been scheduled for wednesday.\ndominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where day and holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\nin the morning radio interview, sanchez cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. last week, carlos suero, the spokesman for the ministry of public health, told fox news in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the dominican republic.\nsuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that sanchez cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\nsuero told fox news that holmes died first and cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\nat the funeral service, bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of day and holmes.\n\"it's a mystery,\" bullock told wtop. \"there's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\nbullock said he was focused on getting more information from u.s. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\n\"we need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said meshonn madison, day's friend.\nsanchez cardenas also singled out the deaths of joseph allen, 55, of new jersey, and leyla cox, 53, of new york. he said allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. he was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\nallen's family has disputed those conclusions.\nthe health minister said cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. however, her family and her former supervisor at the new york hospital where she worked as an mri technician said cox had never suffered a heart attack.\nher son, will cox, lashed out at dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. with the intervention of the u.s. embassy and congressional lawmakers, cox succeeded in getting dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the u.s., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.\n\"we're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,\" the health minister said of leyla cox in the radio interview. \"a person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack.\"", "abs_lastname": "bullock", "abs_firstname": null, "abs_paragraph": "23", "abs_article_id": "423770"}], [{"record_id": 966, "abs_content": "harry and meghan's refurb of their frogmore cottage home has so far cost taxpayers a whopping $3 million in u.s. dollars. the couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.\nroyal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the queen -- is said to have required a \"substantial overhaul\" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.\nbut the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. however, officials said the couple did pay for their own \"fixtures and fittings\". the books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.\nharry, 34, and meghan, 37, moved into their new home in april, a month before baby archie harrison was born. when the sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. but accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near windsor castle cost $3 million in the financial year to april alone.\nany work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. the books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. a luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.\nmeghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer vicky charles. she was responsible for the interiors of soho farmhouse in oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.\nrevealing the royal accounts yesterday, sir michael stevens, keeper of the privy purse, insisted that frogmore cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. he said: \"the property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.\"\nhe added: \"the building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. \"substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by their royal highnesses.\"\na royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. the home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.\nthe main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is \"part of a five-year repainting and repair program.\" they also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.\naccounts for the sovereign grant, which funds the queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the uk. it spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at buckingham palace.\nthe latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a \"blatant misuse of public money\". graham smith, of the republic pressure group, said: \"this year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.\n\"if even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals.\" \"yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw ps2.4million at a new house for harry.\"\nthe royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. this was blamed on the \"higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel\" and there were \"five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18\".\ncharles and camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including africa and the caribbean, while william went to israel and jordan. palace

plans to return to the united states the day they turned up dead.\nseveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, dominican officials said at a news conference last friday. autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. among nearly a dozen u.s. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\nautopsies for day and holmes showed they had enlarged hearts,

families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other u.s. tourists who died in other dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\nmany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in

cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\nsuero told fox news that holmes died first and cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\nat the funeral service, bullock told

to conclusions.\n\"we need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said meshonn madison, day's friend.\nsanchez cardenas also singled out the deaths of joseph allen, 55, of new jersey, and leyla cox, 53, of new york. he said allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. he was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\nallen's family has disputed those conclusions.\nthe health

again monday in a case centering on whether a law that slaps harsher penalties on certain gun possession cases is unconstitutionally vague.\ngorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in united states v. davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. the law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence,\" which is defined as a felony \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" that definition is rather confusing, gorsuch said.\n\"even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,\" he wrote. vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, gorsuch said, when it is really congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.\nin the current case, maurice davis and andre glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the hobbs act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. they were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be \"crimes of violence.\" an appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.\nthe supreme court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. in those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened

picks, justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, were on opposing sides once again monday in a case centering on whether a law that slaps harsher penalties on certain gun possession cases is unconstitutionally vague.\ngorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in united states v. davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. the law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a \"crime of violence,\" which is defined as a felony \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" that definition is rather confusing, gorsuch said.\n\"even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,\" he wrote. vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, gorsuch said, when it is really congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.\nin the current case, maurice davis and andre glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the hobbs act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. they were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be \"crimes of violence.\" an appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.\nthe supreme court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. in those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.\nthe government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.\nkavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. he warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.\n\"the court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,\" kavanaugh wrote. \"the court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than congress

community college tuition-free, free college proposals are all the rage among the democratic presidential candidates. from sen. elizabeth warren's, d-mass., plan to sen. bernie sanders', i-vt., nearly

themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.\nthe argument in support of free college goes something like this: college costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.\ntherefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the united states who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.\nalthough the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.\nfree college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. the rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the national student clearinghouse research center.\nyes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. but it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. if that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's pell grants.\naccording to executives at reup education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.\na challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.\ndoubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.\na second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. the pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.\nalthough college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.\nthe way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.\nthese disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like western governors university and duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.\nfor example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.\ninstead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like kenzie academy and lambda school to traditional colleges. in research for my forthcoming book, \"choosing college,\" my co-author and i found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. a whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.\npolicymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in american society.\ncollege will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. but privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment.", "abs_lastname":

an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.\nunlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ice in 2015 under the obama administration which flew under the radar.\nin short, this operation was exactly what both democratic and republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. it was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!\nas recently reported in the washington examiner, acting department of homeland security (dhs) secretary kevin mcaleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the washington post just prior to the operation's start date.\nif this is true, then mr. mcaleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of president trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection (cbp).\nbefore the \"why\" question can be answered, you must know who mr. mcaleenan really is.\nmr. mcaleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out president trump's immigration agenda.  he has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.\naccording to jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies, mr. mcaleenan was an outspoken proponent of hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election. also, prior to 2010, mr. mcaleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the democratic party as well as democratic candidates.  according to the fec records i've seen, he has never donated to the republican party or a republican candidate.\nagain, i will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. in fact, i consider a number of democratic politicians my friends. but political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. mr. mcaleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.\nat first glance, mr. mcaleenan's bio as cbp commissioner looks very impressive. but upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.\nin fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, mr. mcaleenan has been an utter failure. notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in april of 2015, mr. mcaleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted cbp in keeping the numbers low. instead, mr. mcaleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the united states has ever seen. his job performance has been completely unacceptable.\nnow that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer \"why\" he would stymie an ice operation that had the potential to do so much good. by definition, kevin mcaleenan should be considered anti-trump.\nhis actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and president trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  and while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.\nthe american public

high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.\nalthough the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.\nfree college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. the rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the national student clearinghouse research center.\nyes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. but it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. if that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's pell grants.\naccording to executives at reup education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.\na challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.\ndoubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.\na second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. the pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.\nalthough college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.\nthe way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.\nthese disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like western governors university and duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.\nfor example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.\ninstead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like kenzie academy and lambda school to traditional colleges. in research for my forthcoming book, \"choosing college,\" my co-author and i found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. a whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.\npolicymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional

currently reside in the united states and the number is growing daily.\nin an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.\nunlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ice in 2015 under the obama administration which flew under the radar.\nin short, this operation was exactly what both democratic and republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. it was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!\nas recently reported in the washington examiner, acting department of homeland security (dhs) secretary kevin mcaleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the washington post just prior to the operation's start date.\nif this is true, then mr. mcaleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of president trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection (cbp).\nbefore the \"why\" question can be answered, you must know who mr. mcaleenan really is.\nmr. mcaleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out president trump's immigration agenda.  he has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.\naccording to jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies, mr. mcaleenan was an outspoken proponent of hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election. also, prior to 2010, mr. mcaleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the democratic party as well as democratic candidates.  according to the fec records i've seen, he has never donated to the republican party or a republican candidate.\nagain, i will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. in fact, i consider a number of democratic politicians my friends. but political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. mr. mcaleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.\nat first glance, mr. mcaleenan's bio as cbp commissioner looks very impressive. but upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.\nin fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, mr. mcaleenan has been an utter failure. notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in april of 2015, mr. mcaleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted cbp in keeping the numbers low. instead, mr. mcaleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the united states has ever seen. his job performance has been completely unacceptable.\nnow that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer \"why\" he would stymie an ice operation that had the potential to do so much good. by definition, kevin mcaleenan should be considered anti-trump.\nhis actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and president trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  and while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.\nthe american public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. until the dhs swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security.", "abs_lastname": "obama", "abs_firstname":

interview monday that the maryland couple found dead last month in a hotel room at a luxury resort had pre-existing health problems and may have died after mixing prescription drugs and alcohol.\nin response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim \"absolutely ludicrous.\"\npublic health minister rafael sanchez cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's may 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost \"simultaneously\" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.\n\"the toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,\" sanchez cardenas said. \"there's been talk about drug abuse,\" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. he added that \"they had pre-existing health issues.\"\nsanchez cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the u.s. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.\n\"each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,\" he said. \"every one of these cases can be explained. the autopsies show what happened.\"\nin a text message sent to fox news, steven bullock, the attorney representing the maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \nedward holmes, 63, and cynthia day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the grand bahia principe la romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. the couple, who had been at the resort since may 25, had plans to return to the united states the day they turned up dead.\nseveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, dominican officials said at a news conference last friday. autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. among nearly a dozen u.s. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\nautopsies for day and holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. day was said to have fluid in the brain. on the radio show, the health minister said that holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\nfbi officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a pennsylvania woman, miranda schaup-werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. schaup-werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\nthe news of holmes' and day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other u.s. tourists who died in other dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\nmany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the dominican republic. they have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the u.s.\nthe fbi told fox news last week that the bureau sent a team to the dominican republic to help investigate the deaths.\namong the questions that relatives and some u.s. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\nas sanchez cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview monday morning, friends and family of cynthia day were gathering at the first baptist church of glenarden in maryland for her memorial service. holmes' funeral has been scheduled for wednesday.\ndominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where day and holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\nin the morning radio interview, sanchez cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. last week, carlos suero, the spokesman for the ministry of public health, told fox news in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the dominican republic.\nsuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that sanchez cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\nsuero told fox news that holmes died first and cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\nat the funeral service, bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of day and holmes.\n\"it's a mystery,\" bullock told wtop. \"there's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\nbullock said he was focused on getting more information from u.s. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\n\"we need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said meshonn madison, day's friend.\nsanchez cardenas also singled out the deaths of joseph allen, 55, of new jersey, and leyla cox, 53, of new york. he said allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. he was extremely obese, weighing more than

{"record_id": 976, "abs_content": "a 26-year-old man from north carolina has been charged with murder for shooting and killing a missouri officer who was responding to a call in north st. louis county on sunday, police said monday. \nbonette kymbrelle meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. \nofficer michael langsdorf, who had been with the north county police cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on sunday when meeks shot and killed him, police said. \npolice added that meeks was trying to cash the bad check.\nnorth county police cooperative major ron martin, who introduced himself as a friend of langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on monday he has known the officer for 20 years.\n\"mr. meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,\" martin said. \nthe north county police cooperative's chief, john buchanan, told reporters that langsdorf responded to clay wellston food market restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from st. louis, around 4:30 pm on sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for \"one of our officers down.\" langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a st. louis hospital about 40 minutes later.\nmartin told reporters on monday that when langsdorf confronted meeks inside the market \"a struggle ensued between both of them,\" adding that \"the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.\"\nmartin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. \n\"at some point officer langsdorf was on top of meeks. i don't know how looking at the video mr. meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike officer langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused officer langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on mr. meeks,\" martin said. \n\"mr. meeks was able to stand up and stand over officer langsdorf as officer langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,\" martin continued. \n\"mr. meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of officer langsdorf's head and fired one shot,\" martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.\nmartin said after meeks shot langsdorf in the neck, meeks fled on foot \"gun in hand\" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.\nmartin said that when meeks was arrested, \"he was armed with the pistol he used to murder officer langsdorf.\" \nofficer langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the north county police cooperative's facebook page.\n\"michael was an outstanding officer. in his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,\" buchanan told reporters on monday.\nhe added, \"when we first met he said to me several times, 'all i wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. it was really all i knew how to do.' he told me that numerous times.\" \n\"he [langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. you never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,\" martin told reporters on monday. \"there's no such things as a routine call. this is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day.\" \nhe added, \"i can tell you that mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.\"\nmartin told reporters that officers interviewed meeks and \"ultimately he confessed to murdering officer langsdorf.\"\n\"meeks remains in custody with no bond allowed,\" according to a post on the north county police cooperative's facebook page.\npolice said meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in north carolina.\naccording to criminal records obtained by fox news, meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.\n\"we never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,\" martin said. \n\"it's tough to get a grasp on it all,\" he added. \nlangsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.\n\"the north county police cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family,

highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. they will appear on the second night. the fifth, sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.\ndocumentary producer jody avirgan tweeted monday that some feel \"candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night\" but he disagrees because \"news cycle lasts more than a day\" and trump could do something himself to distract.\nthe msnbc host responded monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 democratic hopefuls.\n\"i swear i have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*\" hayes tweeted.\navirgan fired back, \"i've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.\"\nhayes' nbc is the dnc's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit rachel maddow serving as a moderator.\nit's hardly the first time hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. just last week, the auschwitz memorial responded to hayes after he defended divisive comments by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., who recently compared u.s. border facilities to concentration camps.\nhayes responded to a tweet by rep. liz cheney, which mocked ocasio-cortez for evoking the extermination of six million jewish people during the holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.\n\"if you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the nazis,\" hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend ocasio-cortez.\nbut the verified twitter account of the auschwitz memorial took notice and suggested the msnbc host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.\n\"@chrislhayes please consider following @auschwitzmuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #auschwitz,\" the memorial tweeted.\nfox

decapitated her.\njurors found christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\nthe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\nillinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\nthe federal death-penalty case is the first in illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. some illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\nthe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. the surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare christensen's life.\njurors heard evidence that christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing zhang, starting when the stevens point, wisconsin native was 19 and still living in wisconsin. he began his studies in champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\nhis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the fbi did not rule it out.\nchristensen, now 29, lured zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on june 9, 2017. the muscular christensen forced the 5-foot-4 zhang into his apartment in urbana, champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of chicago, where he raped and killed her.\nzhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\nhe and his girlfriend, terra bullis, attended a vigil for zhang on june 29, during which bullis wore an fbi wire recording him detailing how he killed zhang. as they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"my version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" he responds: \"yeah. that's me.\"\nchristensen was arrested on june 30, 2017, his birthday.\nchristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. in his first few semesters as a doctoral student, christensen was making straight as but by late 2016, was getting fs in all his classes.\nthere

thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his \"democratic socialist\" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. unfortunately for sanders - and also

to be formidable in fund raising. she needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. standing close to biden

to commit robbery under the hobbs act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. they were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were

cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. in those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.\nthe government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but gorsuch argued that an

violent crimes in the past. the law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. as a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.\n\"why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?\" he asked, calling this a \"gaping

job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.\nin the current case, maurice davis and andre glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the hobbs act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. they were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be \"crimes of violence.\" an appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.\nthe supreme court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. in those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a \"violent felony\" or \"crime of violence,\" courts had to look at an \"ordinary case\" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.\nthe government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.\nkavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. he warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.\n\"the court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,\" kavanaugh wrote. \"the court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than congress specified when enacting ss924(c).\"\nkavanaugh addressed the two recent cases gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. the law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. as a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.\n\"why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?\" he asked, calling this a \"gaping hole\" in the majority's analysis.\nthis case is the latest in several this term where kavanaugh and gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.\ngorsuch sided in may with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a native american man convicted for hunting in a national forest. kavanaugh opposed the ruling. a week earlier, kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that apple could be sued by iphone owners over high prices in their app store. gorsuch opposed the ruling.\nfox news' adam shaw contributed to this report.", "abs_lastname": "davis", "abs_firstname": null, "abs_paragraph": "2",

drone.\nabbas mousavi took to twitter to call out president trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means \"closing channel of diplomacy forever,\" according to reuters. \n\"trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,\" the tweet read.\njohn bolton, trump's national security adviser, later said the u.s. open to negotiations, all iran needs to do is \"walk through that open door.\" it was unclear if his response was in connection to mousavi's tweet.\ntrump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said monday that his \"restraint\" is not limitless.\ntrump said the sanctions \"will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support.\" treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the sanctions \"lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.\"\nfox news has confirmed that the u.s. military also carried out a cyberattack against iran last thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an american drone.\nsources said u.s. cyber command launched the cyberattack targeting the iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the u.s. navy drone last week.\nfox news' alex pappas contributed to this report", "abs_lastname": "mousavi", "abs_firstname": "abbas",

"7", "abs_article_id": "424394"}, {"record_id": 819, "abs_content": "four years after president obama proposed making community college tuition-free, free college proposals are all the rage among the democratic presidential candidates. from sen. elizabeth warren's, d-mass., plan to sen. bernie sanders', i-vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.\nthe logic is as alluring as it is faulty. free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.\nthe argument in support of free college goes something like this: college costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.\ntherefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the united states who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.\nalthough the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.\nfree college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. the rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the national student clearinghouse research center.\nyes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. but it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. if that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's pell grants.\naccording to executives at reup education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.\na challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.\ndoubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.\na second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. the pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.\nalthough college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.\nthe way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.\nthese disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like western governors university and duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.\nfor example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.\ninstead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like kenzie academy and lambda school to traditional colleges. in research for my forthcoming book, \"choosing college,\" my co-author and i found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. a whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.\npolicymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in american society.\ncollege will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. but privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment.", "abs_lastname": "warren", "abs_firstname": "elizabeth", "abs_paragraph": "1",

to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. president trump, however, ordered that morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced saturday he was delaying the raids to see if congress could work out a solution to the \"asylum and loophole problems at the southern border.\"\nthe source told fox news that homeland security officials had been planning the raids since april--prior to former acting ice director ron vitiello's departure from the administration amid a dhs staffing shake-up--and that mcaleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\n\"he is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told fox news. \"he has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\non friday, the washington post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing u.s. officials familiar with the operation. the story, written by post immigration reporter nick miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including houston, chicago, miami and los angeles. miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on sunday.\ntom homan, the former head of ice, first suggested in an

leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\nthe source familiar with the matter also told fox news that mcaleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\n\"to have somebody within dhs leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks i have ever seen in my life,\" the source told fox news, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place,

{"record_id": 228, "abs_content": "at least 10 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the united states and the number is growing daily.\nin an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.\nunlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ice in 2015 under the obama administration which flew under the radar.\nin short, this operation was exactly what both democratic and republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. it was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!\nas recently reported in the washington examiner, acting department of homeland security (dhs) secretary kevin mcaleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the washington post just prior to the operation's start date.\nif this is true, then mr. mcaleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of president trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection (cbp).\nbefore the \"why\" question can be answered, you must know who mr. mcaleenan really is.\nmr. mcaleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out president trump's immigration agenda.  he has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.\naccording to jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies, mr. mcaleenan was an outspoken proponent of hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election. also, prior to 2010, mr. mcaleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the democratic party as well as democratic candidates.  according to the fec records i've seen, he has never donated to the republican party or a republican candidate.\nagain, i will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. in fact, i consider a number of democratic politicians my friends. but political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. mr. mcaleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.\nat first glance, mr. mcaleenan's bio as cbp commissioner looks very impressive. but upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.\nin fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, mr. mcaleenan has been an utter failure. notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in april of 2015, mr. mcaleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted cbp in keeping the numbers low. instead, mr. mcaleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the united states has ever seen. his job performance has been completely unacceptable.\nnow that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer \"why\" he would stymie an ice operation that had the potential to do so much good. by definition, kevin mcaleenan should be considered anti-trump.\nhis actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and president trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  and while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.\nthe american public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. until the dhs swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to

oil tanker attacks in the gulf of oman reinforce the need to reestablish a highly visible u.s. naval deterrent in the middle east.\nfor eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. with the united states needing a tougher posture against iran and confronting renewed challenges in asia and europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure america has the carriers it needs.\nthe requirement to maintain carrier presence in the middle east is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which u.s. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.\nindeed, the navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the cold war, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.\nduring the obama administration, a \"rebalance\" supposedly allowed the pentagon to focus on asia and europe while washing its hands of the middle east. in reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the asia-pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the middle east.\nnow with a growing iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the pacific, atlantic and mediterranean.\nthis also places tehran's proxies on the borders of key u.s. allies. beginning next year, tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as u.n. arms embargoes expire. it is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.\nthe trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.\ncredible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for american policymakers.\nlast month's intelligence suggesting iran was ready to move against u.s. interests in the middle east demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden iran. responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the abraham lincoln carrier strike group into the region has dramatically increased the u.s. force posture. effective deterrence of iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.\na combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.\nmost fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in u.s. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan national defense strategy commission late last year.\nat minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. the decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the uss harry s. truman two decades early.\nbut only sustained political will from both the administration and congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the \"navy the nation needs.\"\nworking with the navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.\nthese changes would help address shortcomings in america's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against iran. but they would not be felt for some time, while tehran is already lashing out.\nin the shorter term, the united states could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the mediterranean, the middle east and the pacific.\ncurrently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported navy ships between spain and japan; while very useful against iran, alone they offer little deterrence. coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.\nthe will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the united states has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the u.s. navy's fleet. the result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the middle east for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.\namerican policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. the u.s. navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability.", "abs_lastname": "trump", "abs_firstname": null, "abs_paragraph": "8",

\"hardball\" host invoked the lives lost during the iraq war and how those that died \"weren't the bad guys.\"\n\"the fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,\" matthews elaborated.\n\"we may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, iraqis, who were just there, they were just iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. we only make that calculation now. it's time that -- i like the fact that the president asked up front to his nsc people: how many people will die if we take this step? i think it's good and i'm glad he did it.\"\nthe trump administration announced on monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on iran, hoping to specifically target

recent oil tanker attacks in the gulf of oman reinforce the need to reestablish a highly visible u.s. naval deterrent in the middle east.\nfor eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. with the united states needing a tougher posture against iran and confronting renewed challenges in asia and europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure america has the carriers it needs.\nthe requirement to maintain carrier presence in the middle east is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which u.s. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.\nindeed, the navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the cold war, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.\nduring the obama administration, a \"rebalance\" supposedly allowed the pentagon to focus on asia and europe while washing its hands of the middle east. in reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the asia-pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the middle east.\nnow with a growing iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the pacific, atlantic and mediterranean.\nthis also places tehran's proxies on the borders of key u.s. allies. beginning next year, tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as u.n. arms embargoes expire. it is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.\nthe trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.\ncredible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for american policymakers.\nlast month's intelligence suggesting iran was ready to move against u.s. interests in the middle east demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden iran. responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the abraham lincoln carrier strike group into the region has dramatically increased the u.s. force posture. effective deterrence of iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.\na combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.\nmost fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in u.s. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan national defense strategy commission late last year.\nat minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. the decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the uss harry s. truman two decades early.\nbut only sustained political will from both the administration and congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the \"navy the nation needs.\"\nworking with the navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.\nthese changes would help address shortcomings in america's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against iran. but they would not be felt for some time, while tehran is already lashing out.\nin the shorter term, the united states could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the mediterranean, the middle east and the pacific.\ncurrently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported navy ships between spain and japan; while very useful against iran, alone they offer little deterrence. coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.\nthe will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the united states has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the u.s. navy's fleet. the result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the middle east for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.\namerican policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. the u.s. navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability.", "abs_lastname": "trump", "abs_firstname": null, "abs_paragraph": "8",
