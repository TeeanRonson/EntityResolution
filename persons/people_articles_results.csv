Daniel Webster, 11, has missed school for two years due to illness and school refusal - also known as school phobia. 
Trina Webster said she had letters from mainstream and special schools saying they could not cater for his needs. 
Dudley Council said it was committed to giving children ""the means to reach their full potential.""
Mrs Webster, of Halesowen, spoke to the BBC after seeing Newsnight's investigation into why 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England.
Daniel was six when doctors found he had a tumour in his hip and thigh, said Mrs Webster. 
He was signed off from primary school in 2017 as medically unfit when he was given morphine and other drugs to manage the pain. 
In 2018, he had to have his leg amputated. 
""He had the operation in March but he was doing so well by May we wanted to see if he was ready to go back to school, but it was too soon. He started 'school refusing',"" said Mrs Webster. 
School refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.
He did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.
Now 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.
""Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,"" she said. 
""But they all turned us down. One said he would be isolated because there was no peer group for him. Another said his needs were too complex.""
Instead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. 
The family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. 
""I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,"" said Mrs Webster.

President Trump revealed last week that he called off the strike against Iran following them shooting down a U.S. drone roughly ten minutes before the strike was set to launch after he learned that roughly 150 Iranians would have been killed.
""If Trump had taken military action, I would have come down hard on him,"" Matthews told the panel Monday evening. ""I think it's good that he hesitated. I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.""
The ""Hardball"" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died ""weren't the bad guys.""
""The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,"" Matthews elaborated.
""We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.""
The Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved ""hard-hitting"" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates."

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

For eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. With the United States needing a tougher posture against Iran and confronting renewed challenges in Asia and Europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure America has the carriers it needs.
The requirement to maintain carrier presence in the Middle East is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which U.S. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.
Indeed, the Navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the Cold War, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.
During the Obama administration, a ""rebalance"" supposedly allowed the Pentagon to focus on Asia and Europe while washing its hands of the Middle East. In reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the Asia-Pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the Middle East.
Now with a growing Iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.
This also places Tehran's proxies on the borders of key U.S. allies. Beginning next year, Tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as U.N. arms embargoes expire. It is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent Tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.
Credible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for American policymakers.
Last month's intelligence suggesting Iran was ready to move against U.S. interests in the Middle East demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden Iran. Responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group into the region has dramatically increased the U.S. force posture. Effective deterrence of Iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.
A combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.
Most fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in U.S. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission late last year.
At minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. The decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman two decades early.
But only sustained political will from both the administration and Congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the ""Navy the Nation Needs.""
Working with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.
These changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.
In the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.
Currently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.
The will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.
American policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. The U.S. Navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability."

In the memo, titled ""Initial Message to the Department,"" Esper wrote, ""As we continue to advance the Nation's security, let me reaffirm our path forward. The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives."" 
Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.
Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.
Esper said Monday the department's priorities would ""remain unchanged"" and everything the department did ""should support its stated objectives."" 
He then went on to explain ""three mutually reinforcing lines of effort"" used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""
In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the ""surest way to deter adversary aggression"" and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it's important to ""continue to build readiness to fight"" while ""modernizing key capabilities for future conflict."" 
Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners ""play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world."" He added that through continued engagement the country will ""grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability."" 
Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.
He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.
Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.
""Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,"" Esper wrote in the memo. ""This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive."" 
He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and ""always do the right thing."" 
""Together, we will remain the most ready and capable military force in the world, which is what our nation expects and deserves,"" Esper said.

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters.

John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

Normal people, i.e. people not in the media, and therefore not under the spell of irrational obsessions, saw this as light-hearted trolling, mocking the Triggered Trump Critics like this fella:
Bill Maher: ""If he loses, Trump, he won't go. I've been saying that since before he got elected.""
And he was a comedian - once.
It's so obvious it hurts. But still the media reports Trump's jokes as dire warnings.
Here's a Mediaite headline, screaming: ""Trump posts insane Twitter video threatening to be president for eternity.""
""Threatening.""
What moron writes this stuff? It's hard to say: they got a staff of them.
I'm anxiously awaiting their expose on why the chicken really crossed the road. Or does time really fly if you throw a clock through the air? I bet that gets three Pinocchios.
How did these people get so - to use the medical term - stupid?
Well, the media, once operating under the guise of journalism, are now just hall monitors and pundit-finks. Their job reduced to screaming ""look what someone said on TV! It's a joke - but not to us!""
They barely get out of bed anymore. Their workplace attire: sweatpants and an open bathrobe.
But that's today's media: reporting on you, as you make them the butt of the joke.  Like Chuck!
Chuck Todd: You've joked about a third term, you've joked about these things.
Trump: I only joke. I joke and say 'watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy.'
Chuck Todd: You will accept the result. And you will accept - whatever happens in 2020.
Trump: Sure.
Chuck Todd: You lose, you're gonna be - you're not gonna like it, but you'll walk out.
Trump: Sure. In fact, I said in a speech recently, I said 'watch, we'll drive the media crazy - let's go for a third term, and then a fourth,' and some of the media said 'he's going to do it!'
What a treat - the trolls reporting on how they got trolled. It's too easy, and almost unfair.
To think we're gonna have at least two, three, or four terms of this.

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House.""

""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""

""I am pleased to announce the launch of tmagac.winred.com,"" the president announced Monday on Twitter. ""This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!""
The new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.
While the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.
That advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.
The launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.
WinRed is part of ""The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,"" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's ""a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').""
The president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.
A Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million."

""When I saw that the president was going to have these raids--I mean it was so appalling; it's outside the circle of civilized human behavior to just be kicking down doors, splitting up families, and the rest of that, in addition to the injustices that are happening at the border,"" she said.
Pelosi claimed legislation was in the works to address the immigration crisis but said there's no point in enforcing existing law within the boundaries of the United States.
""We have legislation to go forward to address those needs, but in terms of interior enforcement, what is- what's the point?"" she added. ""Well, I won't even go into what the motivation might be for that here because this is not a political event."""

""I am pleased to announce the launch of tmagac.winred.com,"" the president announced Monday on Twitter. ""This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!""
The new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.
While the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.
That advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.
The launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.
WinRed is part of ""The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,"" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's ""a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').""
The president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.
A Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million."

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

""They're third-party status. It's exactly what Donald Trump is doing and Mitch McConnell, who is completely complicit, is doing [to] the Republican party nationally. And they don't even know what's about to hit them.""
Newsom was asked about his perceived disconnection with middle America and Trump voters at large and said he grew up in a red, rural district which helps him understand the heartland.
""I spent 50 years of my life in rural California in one of the reddest parts of the state, in Placer County. We grew up with these folks, have deep respect for people in rural community [sic]. Deep,"" he said.
""I just don't want them to be lied to. I actually care about them. I'm not using them as a pawn. They're not being respected. They're being lied to. They're not connected to any movement. This guy -- you think Trump cares about them? He's a sole practitioner. You think they're being protected?""

""I honestly am empathetic towards what they are about to experience, which is a profound demise because of their own making,"" he said.
""And until you have some courageous Republicans that stand up and actually make an argument for conservatism... they are finished. They have no governing philosophy, they have no value system that's interesting except fear of others. And those others are going to be a majority. So wake up.""
Newsom also said the current political climate has only bred fear and anxiety and accused Trump of selling voters a bill of goods.
""We're actually ginning up more anxiety, more fear -- which makes communities less safe,"" he said.

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.
At the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.

Trump,PERSON,4259,7,2,"President Trump on Monday unveiled a new online fundraising site to give his re-election campaign and other Republicans running in 2020 a new platform to compete with the Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations.
""I am pleased to announce the launch of tmagac.winred.com,"" the president announced Monday on Twitter. ""This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!""
The new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.
While the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.
That advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.
The launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.
WinRed is part of ""The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,"" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's ""a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').""
The president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.
A Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million."

However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron.

""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. 
He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". 
Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need.""
""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added.
Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. 
""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said.
""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. 
Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. 
The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. 
The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. 
His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.
There has not been a full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities, since 2015 and one is expected in 2020."

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East.""

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.
""The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians."""

The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

The plan worked, but created another problem: Oregon now has way more pot than its 4 million residents can ever possibly hope to smoke. 
According to a 2019 Oregon Liquor Control Commission report, there are about 2,100 grower licensees in the state with enough weed currently on the market that it would take an estimated 6.5 years to sell it all within Oregon without any more production. The glut of marijuana has driven the price of marijuana down and left Oregonians wondering how they'll handle the weed windfall. 
In an attempt to remedy the state's cannabis conundrum, lawmakers in Oregon signed off on two news bills in the last week that would, respectively, cut down on excessive cultivation of marijuana and find new markets for the state's budding pot industry. 
Senate Bill 218 hands the Oregon Liquor Control Board more authority in issuing new licenses to growers based on the supply and demand for weed, while Senate Bill 582 lays the groundwork to eventually allow the governor to enter into agreements with other states for the importing and exporting of marijuana. 
It is currently illegal to transport marijuana across state borders so any moves from the governor's mansion in Salem would have to wait until lawmakers in Washington D.C. decide to make drastic changes to the nation's drug laws - a situation that seems unlikely given the Trump administration's less-than-friendly stance toward legal marijuana.
Currently recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and medical marijuana is legal in 33, and marijuana advocates argue that states like Oregon wouldn't be running into this surplus issue if the substance were permitted to be shipped out of state.
""You have people using water in the desert in Nevada to grow mediocre cannabis, or in Florida, where they have to dehumidify giant spaces, consuming twice the energy,"" Adam J. Smith, founder and director of the Craft Cannabis Alliance based in Oregon, told the Los Angeles Times. ""Oregon wouldn't have an oversupply problem if we could access legal markets like these."""

""Note her typical emotional ploy, using children to get her way. Except when she wants their lives ended,"" Ingraham said on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Monday in response to a clip of Pelosi taking credit for delaying President Trump's ICE raids.
""When I spoke to the President, I said 'Look, I'm a mom, I have five kids, seven, nine grandchildren and children are scared,'""Pelosi said Monday in New York.
""No one wants any child ever to be afraid, ever. It is tragic, and it really shouldn't happen. And kids of American criminals, they suffer here too because of the mistakes of their parents. And parents coming illegally, again tragic but now comes the consequences for the whole family sometimes. Or at least there should be consequences if the rule of law means anything,"" Ingraham told her audience.
The host criticized Pelosi for not taking care of American citizens first and used San Francisco as an example.
""Nancy doesn't need to go far, does she, from San Francisco to see suffering and desperation. We have seen all those stories. Maybe she should focus on fixing that before throwing rocks,"" Ingraham said.
Ingraham also blasted Democrats for remaining silent on the issue when former President Obama faced the same accusations.
""But where were the Democrats? Where were their outrage before Trump came into office?"" Ingram said before playing a clip of Obama.
""Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they will get sent back, more importantly, they may not make it,"" President Obama said in 2014 interview with ABC News.
Ingraham blasted the media, Democrats and Pelosi for misleading the public.
""Now, do any of you remember Nancy Pelosi firing off angry tweets in demanding a change in Obama policy or criticizing these allegedly inhumane conditions?"" Ingraham said.
""Don't be deceived by the media coverage where the motive images you are seeing because it happened years ago and the Democrats were silent."""

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""

However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

A total of 32 people have been infected across Essex with the invasive Group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection.
The outbreak began in Braintree and cases have been found around Chelmsford and Maldon, the Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) report said.
Public Health England has launched an investigation. The CCG has not confirmed when the 12 people died.
Most of those affected are ""elderly and had been receiving care for chronic wounds in the community and care homes"".
The CCG has not said when the first cases were discovered, but did confirm 12 of 32 patients had died - up from 11 deaths and 30 patients mentioned in the report.
Cases were diagnosed in Basildon in 2018 and Southend in February, but ""currently there appears to be no direct link between these cases"" and the initial outbreak in Braintree.
Hundreds of people, including staff in care homes, have been swabbed and community staff working for adult services providers have been given precautionary antibiotic treatment, the CCG said.
Rachel Hearn, director of nursing and quality at Mid Essex CCG, said: ""Our thoughts are with the families of those patients who have died.
""The NHS in Essex is working closely with Public Health England and other partners to manage this local incident, and extra infection control measures have been put in place to prevent the infection spreading in the area.

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.
A Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the ""lavish lifestyle"" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.
David Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

For the front runners and top tier challengers, these nights represent real risks of a blooper that could derail any of them, or an opportunity to address - directly - issues that have been raised about them.
The ""card"" for each night features ten candidates for two hours - with a panel of five NBC moderators. To limit size, the moderators will tag team, so each hour will have thirteen people on stage.
I reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:
My bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected ""bites.""
Sanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum. In 2016, against Hillary Clinton, he was easily able to represent the more progressive ranks of the party. But with Warren feeding a stream of detailed progressive plans, that's harder. His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his ""Democratic Socialist"" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.
Harris has often slipped in unscripted settings, but she continues to be formidable in fund raising. She needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.
My bet for both nights: While the also-rans will seek attention, their sheer volume will enable each of the top front runners to maintain their status, and the race will continue to be a five-way campaign among Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg."

Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.
""Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,"" Doubt said on Monday. 
He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said. ""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""
Lueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.
""Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,"" Doubt said. ""We just want to make sure you are safe and we will respect your wishes.""
Anyone with information on Lueck's disappearance was urged to contact the Salt Lake City Police Department.

St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued  to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis time to take a licensing fight to perform abortions before an administrative panel.
Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside of court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.
TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS
The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.
""We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
She said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, ""abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.""
Republican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.
""We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,"" he said in a statement.
The fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.
The state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three ""failed abortions"" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.
Missouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.

The number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.

For better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.
Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.
At the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.
Warships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets."

Daniel Webster, 11, has missed school for two years due to illness and school refusal - also known as school phobia. 
Trina Webster said she had letters from mainstream and special schools saying they could not cater for his needs. 
Dudley Council said it was committed to giving children ""the means to reach their full potential.""
Mrs Webster, of Halesowen, spoke to the BBC after seeing Newsnight's investigation into why 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England.
Daniel was six when doctors found he had a tumour in his hip and thigh, said Mrs Webster. 
He was signed off from primary school in 2017 as medically unfit when he was given morphine and other drugs to manage the pain. 
In 2018, he had to have his leg amputated. 
""He had the operation in March but he was doing so well by May we wanted to see if he was ready to go back to school, but it was too soon. He started 'school refusing',"" said Mrs Webster. 
School refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.
He did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.
Now 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.
""Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,"" she said.

Instead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. 
The family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. 
""I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,"" said Mrs Webster.

Bethlehem is Jesus' birthplace, according to Christian tradition. The font is estimated to date back to between 501 and 600 A.D.
Ziad al-Bandak, head of a Palestinian presidential committee leading the church renovation, said Saturday that international experts are arriving in the biblical West Bank town to examine the receptacle.
Al-Bandak described the Byzantine font as a ""magnificent"" discovery that had been covered by the larger known vessel.
A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Church of the Nativity is located about 6.2 miles south of Jerusalem. The church is built on the site identified as Jesus' birthplace by Christian tradition.
A restoration project was launched five years ago to overcome decades of neglect at the historic church.
Palestinian news agency WAFA reports that a ceremony to celebrate the end of the restoration project, which was planned for November, has been pushed back to May 2020. The postponement will allow the three churches in charge of the Church of the Nativity to undertake a restoration of the church's grotto, WAFA reports.
In a separate project at the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, archaeologists have been hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.

The printing is on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia through the end of 2019. This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.
Printed by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col. David Mulford, a Revolutionary War colonel who died of smallpox in 1778. The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.
""The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,"" said Kinyon in a statement. ""Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.""
""We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,"" said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, President and CEO of the Museum of the American Revolution. ""It is humbling to stand in the presence of such an authentic witness to our nation's birth.""
Revolutionary War artifacts offer a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America. Items in the Museum of the American Revolution's collection include George Washington's tent and his headquarters flag.
In December 2018, the remains of the famous Revolutionary War frigate USS Bonhomme Richard were discovered off the coast of the U.K., more than 200 years after it sank following a naval battle.
Earlier this year, a rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War went on display at the Museum of the American Revolution.

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

The boisterous songstress opened up in a big way about her life as it is today and in true Halsey fashion, leaving no topic unexamined -- including her bipolar disorder, her ongoing battle to remain sober, and being a survivor of sexual assault. 
Simply put, Halsey has seen an eyeful in her two decades of life.
""I know I'm just going to get f---ing depressed and be boring again soon,"" the 24-year-old told Rolling Stone of her manic and often unpredictable diagnosis in an interview published Monday. ""And I hate that that's a way of thinking. Every time I wake up and realize I'm back in a depressive episode, I'm bummed.""
Halsey, whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, said she was diagnosed as bipolar at age 17 following a suicide attempt. However, she says she now embraces who she is and everything her diagnosis comes with -- even if her mental state makes her more explosive and prone to doing ""crazy s---.""
After ""getting cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times"" and splitting with rapper G-Eazy for good, Halsey has a much clearer conscience and has seemed to find her purpose. She managed to stay atop the charts for 12 consecutive weeks with ""Closer,"" her collaboration with the Chainsmokers -- and also landed her a first number one solo single with ""Without Me,"" an ode to her breakup with the Bay Area emcee. 
In the lengthy artist profile, the ""Ghost"" performer who has been an advocate for survivors of sexual abuse said she recently confronted her abuser. The multiplatinum artist said the person who allegedly abused her ""took it seriously, went to rehab, sought therapy."" 
While she is glad she is now able to speak out about her difficult past, Halsey refuses to be categorized as a victim. ""I have worked way too f---ing hard to be quantified or categorized by something like that,"" she said.  ""Then I'm not 'Grammy-nominated pop star,' then I'm 'rape survivor,'"" she said with a tremor. 
""Uh-uh, no. Absolutely not,"" she added.
Halsey admitted that she had been in a dark place during her journey and said she has made massive changes in her life to correct the negative imbalances she carried. This started with letting go of the drugs and adjusting her drinking habits.
""I support my whole family,"" she said. ""I have multiple houses, I pay taxes, I run a business. I just can't be out getting f--- up all the time.""
Catch Halsey gracing the cover of Rolling Stone's ""Hot Issue"" on newsstands July 2."

Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.
""Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,"" Doubt said on Monday. 
He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said. ""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""

Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.
""Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,"" Doubt said on Monday. 
He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said.

""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""
Lueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.
""Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,"" Doubt said. ""We just want to make sure you are safe and we will respect your wishes.""
Anyone with information on Lueck's disappearance was urged to contact the Salt Lake City Police Department.

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.
At the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.
Warships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets."

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.
The logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.
The argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.
Therefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.
Although the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.
Free college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Yes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.
According to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.
A challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.
Doubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.
A second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.
Although college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.
The way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.
These disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.
For example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.
Instead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, ""Choosing College,"" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.
Policymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.
College will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, claimed on Monday that it was ""literally easier"" for her to win her historic election as the youngest lawmaker on Capitol Hill than to pay off her student loan debt.
The freshman New Yorker, who now a $170,000 salary as a congresswoman after previously working as a bartender, made the surprising remark after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, debuted his plan Monday to tackle the student loan crisis by proposing to eliminate the whopping $1.6 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street.
""This proposal will make it possible for every person in America to get a college education no matter what their financial situation,"" Sanders said. ""We will make a full and complete education a fundamental right.""
The freshman congresswoman expressed her support for the proposed legislation.
""I will be completely honest,"" Ocasio-Cortez began.
""I will disclose my personal stake in this fight because I have student loans too. And I think it's so funny that a year ago, I was waiting tables at a restaurant and it was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt.
""So that should tell you everything about the state of this economy and the state of quality of life for working people.""
She continued, ""In order for me to get a chance to have health care, in order for me to get a chance to pay off my student loans, I had to do something that was nearly impossible and I don't think that is the bar through which a person should be able to access education, health care, and a bevy of other things that should be considered human rights."""

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

In the memo, titled ""Initial Message to the Department,"" Esper wrote, ""As we continue to advance the Nation's security, let me reaffirm our path forward. The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives."" 
Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.
Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.
Esper said Monday the department's priorities would ""remain unchanged"" and everything the department did ""should support its stated objectives."" 
He then went on to explain ""three mutually reinforcing lines of effort"" used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""
In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the ""surest way to deter adversary aggression"" and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it's important to ""continue to build readiness to fight"" while ""modernizing key capabilities for future conflict."" 
Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners ""play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world."" He added that through continued engagement the country will ""grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability."" 
Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.
He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.
Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.
""Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,"" Esper wrote in the memo. ""This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive."" 
He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and ""always do the right thing.""

A total of 32 people have been infected across Essex with the invasive Group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection.
The outbreak began in Braintree and cases have been found around Chelmsford and Maldon, the Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) report said.
Public Health England has launched an investigation. The CCG has not confirmed when the 12 people died.
Most of those affected are ""elderly and had been receiving care for chronic wounds in the community and care homes"".
The CCG has not said when the first cases were discovered, but did confirm 12 of 32 patients had died - up from 11 deaths and 30 patients mentioned in the report.
Cases were diagnosed in Basildon in 2018 and Southend in February, but ""currently there appears to be no direct link between these cases"" and the initial outbreak in Braintree.
Hundreds of people, including staff in care homes, have been swabbed and community staff working for adult services providers have been given precautionary antibiotic treatment, the CCG said.
Rachel Hearn, director of nursing and quality at Mid Essex CCG, said: ""Our thoughts are with the families of those patients who have died.
""The NHS in Essex is working closely with Public Health England and other partners to manage this local incident, and extra infection control measures have been put in place to prevent the infection spreading in the area.
""The risk of contracting iGAS is very low for the vast majority of people and treatment with antibiotics is very effective, if started early.""
The bacteria can live ""on hands or the throat for long enough to allow easy spread between people through sneezing, kissing and skin contact"", according to the report."

Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.
The swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.
Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.
He and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: ""My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer."" He responds: ""Yeah. That's me.""
Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.
Christensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.
There are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.
Zhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.

The International Olympic Committee on Monday voted to hold the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.
Italy won the bid over Stockholm-Are, of Sweden, to host the Winter Games. It'll be the first time the Games will be held in Italy since Turin hosted in 2006.
Cortina d'Ampezzo, a ski town in northern Italy, hosted the Olympics in 1956. Sweden has never hosted the Winter Games, but Stockholm was the host of the 1912 Summer Games.
Both Italy and Sweden's bids made their final pitches to the IOC on Monday during a nine-hour meeting to choose a winner.
In their final presentations to win the bid from the IOC, the prime ministers of Italy and Sweden both pushed for their nations to host the 2026 games.
Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, noted that support in Italy is strong for an Olympic Games, and was a focal point of their bid. His presentation highlighted how 83 percent of the Italian population is in favor of the games, with 87 percent rising in Milan.
He said: ""If I am here today in front of you, it is thanks to the enthusiasm of all Italy. ... This is the dream of an entire country, and not only the government but also the regions.""
Sweden Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""it's in our DNA"" to deliver a stable Winter Games after the IOC's own polling determined there was around 60 percent public backing in Sweden to host the games. The bid was challenged to prove its support from a Stockholm city authority coalition formed last October and a national government only five months ago.
The mayor of Stockholm, Anna Konig Jerlmyr, played up ABBA -- Sweden's most famous musical act -- telling the committee: ""ABBA is everywhere."" She then broke out into her own rendition of ""Dancing Queen.""

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.

Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

Faith Taylor, the woman who took the photo, told KCRA that she didn't want to walk over to the couple because she didn't want to interrupt the moment. There already appeared to be a professional photographer there.
""At Yosemite, a couple was getting engagement photos taken and when I went to take a pic of their glory, a beam of LIGHT shown on them,"" she posted on Twitter. ""I. Am. Emotional. Someone find them.""
She posted that there was a false alarm on Sunday that didn't pan out.

In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

""They are in this lunatic derby. This is why Democratic leaders are rightly afraid of what's going on. Because, if Sanders - who is now promising to forgive the student loans of everybody, basically, 'throw in another trillion dollars,' - if either Sanders or Warren get the nomination, there is a reality that Democrats won't just miss out on taking the White House back, but they could get cleaned out in the Senate.""
Stirewalt claimed there is a danger the two candidates' platforms could cause Democrats to also lose control of the House.
""This stuff is way outside the mainstream,"" he claimed. ""That's what Democrats are afraid of.""
During a speech Saturday at Clinton College in Rock Hill, S.C., Sanders claimed graduates are put in an ""absurd position of having to pay that debt off for decades.""
""Some of those people, they can't afford to get married,"" he said, in a clip played by host Dana Perino.
""They can afford to have kids. They can't afford to buy their own home. Well, we are going to change that."""

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details.

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.

Not Buying It claimed the recordings in Victorias and Obsessions lap dancing clubs in Manchester showed breaches in licensing rules, including sexual acts.
The group said covert filming was the ""only way to get anything done about the strip industry"".
A union has compared it to ""revenge porn"".
Not Buying It said it had taken the ""drastic step"" of hiring investigators to film strippers in March to ""expose how the industry really operates"".
Both Victorias and Obsessions offer ""full, nude"" lap dances in ""discreet"" private rooms.
Not Buying It claimed to have filmed dancers both touching themselves sexually and ""straddling"" investigators, despite licensing rules disallowing contact. 
One dancer offered prostitution, the group claimed. 
However ""Daisy"", a Manchester-based dancer who was filmed, said: ""I certainly don't offer 'extras' and I don't know any other girls who do.""
She said her biggest fear was the footage being leaked.
""I consent to being on CCTV, I consent to it every night when I go to work [because it keeps me safe] but I don't consent to them filming me.
""We have a right to our body, despite what we do for a job, and they've taken that right completely away from us.""
A spokesperson for Victorias said it had ""taken these allegations seriously"" and was co-operating fully with a council investigation.  
Victorias had ""not knowingly contravened or permitted the contravention of any term or condition of their licence,"" they added.  
Obsessions has also been approached for comment.
Not Buying It said it chose to visit two lap dancing clubs in Manchester because of ""numerous, serious"" incidents linked to clubs in the city, but added: ""We have no doubt that they could have gone into any club in the country and found the same.""  
Campaigner Dr Sasha Rakoff said: ""We have been telling councils for years of the extreme harm and abuse of the strip industry. 
""Nothing has been listened to.""
Dr Rakoff said she hoped the filming would now show councillors the strip industry was ""hugely harmful and abusive"".  
Daisy (not her real name) said: ""This industry is legal. It's licensed. I don't understand what they're trying to expose. 
""When I go into work I feel completely in control. I am in control of my body, of who sees me, of what I do. I've lost that control, they've taken that away from me."" 
United Voices of the World Union (UVW), which represents workers in the sex industry, said it was appalled by the ""duplicitous 'sting' operations"" in Manchester, which had ""violated women's right to privacy.""
""Sharing undercover footage of naked women constitutes revenge porn and UVW will take legal action against anyone who uses this tactic to harm our members,"" it said. 
The footage collected has been sent to Manchester City Council, which said an investigation was continuing.

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.

Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

Mark Meadows, R-N.C.
Connecticut federal prosecutor John Durham is looking closely at the intelligence community's activity in late 2016 and early 2017, the House Freedom Caucus chairman claimed on ""Hannity.""
""I can tell you that John Durham and Attorney General Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" he said.
""They are including in part of their surveillance - really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who joined Meadows on ""Hannity,"" added he agreed with the North Carolina lawmaker and that a previous report by the Justice Department's inspector general was fruitful.
""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation,"" he said. ""They have told us this is broader than just the FBI - they're going to look at all of this.
""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.
""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""
As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""
Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, led by Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services.""
Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.
Fifth-ranked Canada, which finished second in its group after a 2-1 loss to the Dutch, has bronze medals in the last two Olympics but fell to England in the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup on home soil."

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.
At the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.
Warships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets."

Now, he travels the country helping people avoid the same fate when it comes to meeting strangers online.
Schulman, 34, hosts the MTV series ""Catfish"" in which he investigates the stories of people who believe they are getting ""catfished"" by a nefarious, or lonely, person hiding behind a curtain of lies. Sometimes the stories end in heartbreak, but some end with genuine human connections. However, speaking to Fox News, Schulman made it clear that the one thing they all have in common is that they're all shocking in some way.
""It's interesting, I have made, I think now over 140 episodes of the show, and not any two have been alike. They've been similar in certain ways but there's always some unforeseeable, unpredictable twist that finds its way into the story whether it's at the beginning, middle or end,"" Schulman said. ""This last season that's airing now is no different. I think as the internet continues to evolve, and as we continue to figure out how we interact with it and use it and explore it, new stuff just keeps coming up.""
It's safe to say that, after more than 140 investigations and having once been the victim of a catfish himself, Schulman is an expert on sussing out frauds. Although he says social interactions are changing as quickly as technology is developing, there are some patterns that remain the same.
""It's funny, the nature of the relationships I see on 'Catfish' are all very specific. It's people who, for the most part, met as friends. Once in a while, it will start in a dating app, but usually it's unsuspecting,"" he explained. ""You're online, you get a 'friend request' from someone you don't really know, but you have some mutual friends so you say 'sure.' Then they start acting very friendly and you become enamored by them and flirtation leads to the next thing and before you know it, you're in a relationship.""
Schulman stops short of equating getting catfished exclusively with online dating because he's seen these deep  ""relationships"" develop out of friendship or an innocuous non-romantic conversation countless times. However, when it comes to ways to avoid getting catfished in 2019, the host says the basics haven't changed.
""Obviously you can get lied to or have a bad date. But the trouble is when you invest too much of yourself into a relationship that you haven't met,"" he explained. ""I would say the trend, or if people are going to online date, just know that if you're talking to someone for maybe, I don't know, a couple weeks, barring any strange circumstances like travel or work and they can't meet up with you... Something is probably off, and that's what you have to look out for.""
Schulman hosts a new crop of episodes debuting in June on MTV. Although he's going without his longtime co-host Max Joseph, who left the show in 2018, he's excited to get back out there and help some people.
""I am excited about this season of 'Catfish' for a lot of reasons. We went to some wild new places, we had things that have never happened happen to us and I have a bunch of really great co-hosts this season. Some you've seen before, some you haven't, who just bring incredible fresh energy to the show and we had a lot of fun. So, I think I want people to watch the show because there's a lot of TV you can watch that might not change the way you think about yourself, but our show pushes people to change the way they talk about one another in many ways."""

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.
""Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,"" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family."

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""
""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

I reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:
My bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected ""bites.""
Sanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum.

His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his ""Democratic Socialist"" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.
Harris has often slipped in unscripted settings, but she continues to be formidable in fund raising. She needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.

Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.
My bet for both nights: While the also-rans will seek attention, their sheer volume will enable each of the top front runners to maintain their status, and the race will continue to be a five-way campaign among Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg."

For the current second tier, this may represent an opportunity for them to break out from a pack whose sheer size - and intense national schedule - makes this year more challenging for what we might charitably call campaign ""asterisks."" For the front runners and top tier challengers, these nights represent real risks of a blooper that could derail any of them, or an opportunity to address - directly - issues that have been raised about them.
The ""card"" for each night features ten candidates for two hours - with a panel of five NBC moderators. To limit size, the moderators will tag team, so each hour will have thirteen people on stage.
I reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:
My bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected ""bites.""
Sanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum. In 2016, against Hillary Clinton, he was easily able to represent the more progressive ranks of the party. But with Warren feeding a stream of detailed progressive plans, that's harder. His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his ""Democratic Socialist"" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas.

The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

On Monday, Fox News' Geraldo Rivera and Juan Williams discussed Buttigieg's handling of the town hall and his cities unhappiness regarding race relations and the police department.
""The black one-third of South Bend has apparently turned against the mayor. He's had an incredible run, Mayor Pete has, but I think that the rubber has met the road,"" Rivera said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum.""
A town hall Sunday became chaotic as the city struggled to respond to a deadly police-involved shooting last week that that highlighted a disconnect between African-American residents and Buttigieg.
Rivera suggested Buttigieg's candidacy is likely to end in South Carolina after the recent controversy.
""It seems to me that unless he can turn this around, his candidacy will hit South Carolina and end there, seems to me. He's not being accepted by the African-American community,"" Rivera said.
Williams agreed with Rivera's assessment, saying Buttigieg is looking like he's ""small town mayor"" -- not presidential.

 ""I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor. If he doesn't deal with this crises, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation,"" Williams said.
Williams also compared Buttigieg's controversy to former Vice President Joe Biden's recent blowback from saying that he was able to work with segregationists senators, saying it wasn't ""as serious as what Pete Buttigieg is going through.""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, claimed on Monday that it was ""literally easier"" for her to win her historic election as the youngest lawmaker on Capitol Hill than to pay off her student loan debt.
The freshman New Yorker, who now a $170,000 salary as a congresswoman after previously working as a bartender, made the surprising remark after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, debuted his plan Monday to tackle the student loan crisis by proposing to eliminate the whopping $1.6 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street.
""This proposal will make it possible for every person in America to get a college education no matter what their financial situation,"" Sanders said. ""We will make a full and complete education a fundamental right.""
The freshman congresswoman expressed her support for the proposed legislation.
""I will be completely honest,"" Ocasio-Cortez began.
""I will disclose my personal stake in this fight because I have student loans too. And I think it's so funny that a year ago, I was waiting tables at a restaurant and it was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt.
""So that should tell you everything about the state of this economy and the state of quality of life for working people.""
She continued, ""In order for me to get a chance to have health care, in order for me to get a chance to pay off my student loans, I had to do something that was nearly impossible and I don't think that is the bar through which a person should be able to access education, health care, and a bevy of other things that should be considered human rights."""

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

""First of all, you're going to want to establish credibility, especially among skeptical young voters. Tell them the story of how you met mom... weave it into a reflection about how hard it is to find, like, 'the one' on tinder.""
The mayor wasn't impressed with his son's initial advice and informed him that he's looking for a universal message.
""Ah, ok,"" Dante responded. Well, in a time of unprecedented national division, one thing we can all agree on are dogs. You're going to want to build your platform and performance around them.""
Dante then told his father to bring photos or even a litter of puppies to the debate stage.
""That is definitely a creative approach... but how about something that allows me to stand out by talking about my accomplishments? I need to impress the American people,"" de Blasio told his son.
Dante told his father to tell people that New York City was ""just Staten Island"" when he started his first term.
The conversation continued with the mayor asking his son how to make his presence felt on the stage. Dante tells his father to ""leap over the moderator"" to dunk a basketball before they express love for each other.
The conversation was quickly mocked, with many people responding that he should fix the subways in New York City before worrying about a presidential bid.

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

Biden has been taking heat that could hurt his chances to be the Democratic nominee, Trump suggested during an interview on ""The Todd Starnes Show.""
""I don't know what's going on with Joe Biden,"" she said.
""We don't know if Joe Biden is going to be who we run against in 2020, but it certainly isn't looking promising for him. I feel like he's really started to tank a little bit earlier than anyone expected.
""Maybe he regrets now even deciding to run, because there's been a lot that's happened that doesn't look great for him since he announced he was running for president.""
Host Todd Starnes then raised two recent controversies the former vice president has faced -- accusations of inappropriate touching from several women, as well as comments he made about working with segregationist senators.
Trump said such instances are more reason her father-in-law, President Trump, should allow Democrats to battle amongst themselves.
""With all the Democrats, I say just let them keep digging,"" she said.
""I don't know who gave them the shovel but let them keep digging it deeper. We're going to see the debates this week. It should be very interesting.

Mark Wells, who played forward on the gold medal team that upset the Soviet Union on their way to the matchup against Finland to win the medal, gave the stick to the St. Clair Shores Civic Arena in Michigan in 1980 - the last time it was seen.
St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby announced last Monday that Wells' stick had been returned to the arena, according to the Macomb Daily. He declined to give details but said Wells was happy that stick was back in the arena - where he had intended to be 39 years ago.
""It's history,"" Walby said. ""To have an individual from St. Clair Shores be part of the 1980 hockey team was great.""
Each team member received a stick autographed by the players and coach Herb Brooks. Similar sticks have sold for $290,000 in recent years, according to the Macomb Daily.
The stick is being protected by the St. Clair Shores Police Department for the time being.
It's unclear where the stick has been for all these years.
Wells played 29 games for Team USA, scoring nine goals and seven assists.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

For better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.
Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

Now, he travels the country helping people avoid the same fate when it comes to meeting strangers online.
Schulman, 34, hosts the MTV series ""Catfish"" in which he investigates the stories of people who believe they are getting ""catfished"" by a nefarious, or lonely, person hiding behind a curtain of lies. Sometimes the stories end in heartbreak, but some end with genuine human connections. However, speaking to Fox News, Schulman made it clear that the one thing they all have in common is that they're all shocking in some way.
""It's interesting, I have made, I think now over 140 episodes of the show, and not any two have been alike. They've been similar in certain ways but there's always some unforeseeable, unpredictable twist that finds its way into the story whether it's at the beginning, middle or end,"" Schulman said. ""This last season that's airing now is no different. I think as the internet continues to evolve, and as we continue to figure out how we interact with it and use it and explore it, new stuff just keeps coming up.""
It's safe to say that, after more than 140 investigations and having once been the victim of a catfish himself, Schulman is an expert on sussing out frauds. Although he says social interactions are changing as quickly as technology is developing, there are some patterns that remain the same.
""It's funny, the nature of the relationships I see on 'Catfish' are all very specific. It's people who, for the most part, met as friends. Once in a while, it will start in a dating app, but usually it's unsuspecting,"" he explained. ""You're online, you get a 'friend request' from someone you don't really know, but you have some mutual friends so you say 'sure.' Then they start acting very friendly and you become enamored by them and flirtation leads to the next thing and before you know it, you're in a relationship.""
Schulman stops short of equating getting catfished exclusively with online dating because he's seen these deep  ""relationships"" develop out of friendship or an innocuous non-romantic conversation countless times. However, when it comes to ways to avoid getting catfished in 2019, the host says the basics haven't changed.
""Obviously you can get lied to or have a bad date. But the trouble is when you invest too much of yourself into a relationship that you haven't met,"" he explained. ""I would say the trend, or if people are going to online date, just know that if you're talking to someone for maybe, I don't know, a couple weeks, barring any strange circumstances like travel or work and they can't meet up with you... Something is probably off, and that's what you have to look out for.""
Schulman hosts a new crop of episodes debuting in June on MTV. Although he's going without his longtime co-host Max Joseph, who left the show in 2018, he's excited to get back out there and help some people.
""I am excited about this season of 'Catfish' for a lot of reasons.

Daniel Webster, 11, has missed school for two years due to illness and school refusal - also known as school phobia. 
Trina Webster said she had letters from mainstream and special schools saying they could not cater for his needs. 
Dudley Council said it was committed to giving children ""the means to reach their full potential.""
Mrs Webster, of Halesowen, spoke to the BBC after seeing Newsnight's investigation into why 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England.
Daniel was six when doctors found he had a tumour in his hip and thigh, said Mrs Webster. 
He was signed off from primary school in 2017 as medically unfit when he was given morphine and other drugs to manage the pain. 
In 2018, he had to have his leg amputated. 
""He had the operation in March but he was doing so well by May we wanted to see if he was ready to go back to school, but it was too soon. He started 'school refusing',"" said Mrs Webster. 
School refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.
He did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.
Now 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.
""Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,"" she said. 
""But they all turned us down. One said he would be isolated because there was no peer group for him. Another said his needs were too complex.""
Instead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. 
The family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. 
""I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,"" said Mrs Webster. 
""It's so frustrating. It's not just his physical needs, it's emotional too. We don't want him in a noisy, pressure-filled environment.""
Councillor Ruth Buttery, cabinet member for children and young people, said: ""Working in conjunction with health and education providers, we are determined to provide the best possible outcomes for pupils with Send or additional health needs and we have recently appointed two specialist education officers to support and advice parents and carers."""

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.
Fox News' Guerin Hays, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.
A Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the ""lavish lifestyle"" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.
David Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.
""Horse manure,"" Lammy wrote on Twitter. ""What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?""
Collins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.
Facebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday."

Andrew and Karen Wilson, both now 59, were first introduced when they were ""practically forced"" together in school in 1971.
The couple was originally ""disappointed"" when they were told to sit next to each other in class -- because they ""were the two stragglers"" -- at Riversmead School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England.
After a year, the pair grew close, becoming friends, but ""nothing happened"" and they went their separate ways after finishing school in 1976.
But now, over four decades later Karen and Andrew have tied the knot after they reconnected with each other over Facebook.
""So it took a while, 45 years, before I finally got the courage to ask Karen out on a date, but I finally got my girl,"" Andrew said.
""I quite fancied Karen at school but was way to shy to say anything,"" he added.
Karen, meanwhile, said she didn't even know Andrew liked her.
""I always thought he was so well put together but little did I know he actually liked me and was making an effort with me,"" Karen said. ""In second term, Andrew decided he liked me and I didn't mind spending another term with him. But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.
""And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.""
After losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.
However, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.
The pair said they would often chat ""for hours"" until Andrew ""picked up the courage"" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.
However, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.
""We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,"" said Karen.
""We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.
""He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.
""It couldn't have gone any better. I think if I had actually met him the day we were supposed to meet, I would have been a nervous wreck. But because it was the day before, I got surprised.""
Andrew proposed to Karen in June 2018 in Paris. They married on June 22, and are now on their honeymoon in Italy.
""I just want to say to all the women out there because careful what you wish for, because wishes do come true,"" Karen said.

Andrew and Karen Wilson, both now 59, were first introduced when they were ""practically forced"" together in school in 1971.
The couple was originally ""disappointed"" when they were told to sit next to each other in class -- because they ""were the two stragglers"" -- at Riversmead School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England.
After a year, the pair grew close, becoming friends, but ""nothing happened"" and they went their separate ways after finishing school in 1976.
But now, over four decades later Karen and Andrew have tied the knot after they reconnected with each other over Facebook.
""So it took a while, 45 years, before I finally got the courage to ask Karen out on a date, but I finally got my girl,"" Andrew said.
""I quite fancied Karen at school but was way to shy to say anything,"" he added.
Karen, meanwhile, said she didn't even know Andrew liked her.
""I always thought he was so well put together but little did I know he actually liked me and was making an effort with me,"" Karen said. ""In second term, Andrew decided he liked me and I didn't mind spending another term with him. But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.
""And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.""
After losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.
However, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.
The pair said they would often chat ""for hours"" until Andrew ""picked up the courage"" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.
However, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.
""We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,"" said Karen.
""We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.
""He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.

""They brought in this perfect young man who had no vital signs,"" said Dr. Angel Chudler, an emergency room physician at Beaumont Hospital, according to the hospital's blog. ""I said to my team, 'We're bringing him back.' And then I said to him, 'You better come back!'""
And after another jolt from the defibrillator, 20-year-old Michael Truitt came back.
""When he became conscious again, he was like the Hulk, grabbing the railings and shaking the bed with huge strength. It took the entire care team to hold Michael,"" Yasmeen Bachir, a clinical nurse who helped care for Truitt, said in the blog post, which also stated that Truitt was ""dead for 20 minutes"" prior to resuscitation.
Truitt had been working with his stepdad at a home in Livonia when a metal ladder he was carrying touched a live electrical wire. He said he doesn't remember anything past that, but the homeowner called 911 and started CPR. It took about four minutes for paramedics to arrive and they attempted to revive him with the defibrillator while en route to the hospital, but he never regained a heartbeat in the ambulance.
""In less than five minutes, brain cells start to die from lack of oxygen,"" Barbara Smith, the director of trauma services at Beaumont, told the hospital blog. ""Michael's resuscitation is miraculous. He did not lose any brain function. It's a testament to the importance of immediate continuous CPR to move oxygenated blood to the brain.""
The only lasting injury Pruitt has from the ordeal is in his toes, where the voltage electricity exited through his body, the website said."

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

The 54-year-old model brightened up the day of her social media followers on Sunday when she shared a stunning shot to Instagram.
Captioned ""Sunshine Bikini for gloriously sunny LA,"" Hurley glowed as she rocked a yellow bikini top with a deep neckline, which she accented with heart-shaped sunglasses.
Hurley has been on a tear since ringing in her 54th birthday just two weeks ago. The mother of Damian Hurley -- an actor and budding fashion model himself -- has remained one of the industry's leading age-defying women and recently spilled the beans on how she remains in top shape.
""I think we have to stay active, whether it's formal exercise or just moving around a lot,"" the British model told Closer Weekly last month. ""I think we have to watch what we eat. We all know that. Everybody tells us that, but we have to watch what we eat.""
But while the Estee Lauder model admitted she isn't keen on partaking in diet fads, Hurley can't help herself when it comes to topping off her plate with a heap of vegetables -- something she said has helped her figure immensely over the years.
""I eat meat and fish, but I also eat a lot of vegetables, and I've been really trying in the last year that 50 percent of the foods I eat are vegetables,"" she told the outlet. ""It's not easy but I'm trying -- and I think it really makes a difference actually.""
Earlier this month, it was also revealed that the actress will be starring in the third season of ""Runaways"" on Hulu, according to Variety. The actress will be playing villain Morgan le Fay on the Marvel series, the outlet reported.

The A-lister, 72, is to visit Manchester, London and Birmingham to share ""untold stories"" and promote his final Rambo film ""Last Blood.""
The black-tie dinner, called ""An Evening with Sylvester Stallone"" which takes place across three dates in August and September, will see a live stage interview, a three-course dinner, film prop models and an auction selling signed memorabilia.
The cheapest packages start at $160 a ticket but go up to $1,081 for the ""premium photo experience"" which allows film buffs to get a selfie with the man himself.
But fans have hit out on social media at the cost.
One said: ""It's a shame you'd need to sell a kidney to go."" Another joked on Facebook: ""Would love to go but PS500 for a photo. Would want a neet oot [night out on the town] with him for that and him buying the beers."" In response, the official ""An Experience With"" account defended the high prices.
They said: ""As with any business there are costs involved and this is the same for us as a company.
""When you take into consideration the costs to bring a celebrity of such status to the UK then you would understand why.
""As for the photos we are allowed only 150 from management so due to this, the exclusivity dictates the price.
""We work with A-list celebs and unfortunately quality costs."" The same event with Arnold Schwarzenegger charges fans the same, while a selfie with Mel Gibson is cheaper at $828.
They have both sold out but tickets are still available to see Sylvester Stallone.

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued  to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis time to take a licensing fight to perform abortions before an administrative panel.
Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside of court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.
TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS
The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.
""We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
She said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, ""abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.""
Republican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.
""We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,"" he said in a statement.
The fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.
The state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three ""failed abortions"" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.
Missouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.

The number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling.

The Californian Democrat made the stunning claim during an interview with Axios that aired Sunday.
""I'm just hearing stuff that gins up a smaller and smaller base of people. And that's my point... California in the 1990s is a lot like America in 2019, 2020, 2021. And here's the real story -- The Republican party was walked off a cliff,"" Newsom said.
""They're third-party status. It's exactly what Donald Trump is doing and Mitch McConnell, who is completely complicit, is doing [to] the Republican party nationally. And they don't even know what's about to hit them.""
Newsom was asked about his perceived disconnection with middle America and Trump voters at large and said he grew up in a red, rural district which helps him understand the heartland.
""I spent 50 years of my life in rural California in one of the reddest parts of the state, in Placer County. We grew up with these folks, have deep respect for people in rural community [sic]. Deep,"" he said.
""I just don't want them to be lied to. I actually care about them. I'm not using them as a pawn. They're not being respected. They're being lied to. They're not connected to any movement. This guy -- you think Trump cares about them? He's a sole practitioner. You think they're being protected?""
Newsom said he has empathy for the GOP because they don't realize how far they're going to fall, as a result of their own actions.
""I honestly am empathetic towards what they are about to experience, which is a profound demise because of their own making,"" he said.
""And until you have some courageous Republicans that stand up and actually make an argument for conservatism... they are finished. They have no governing philosophy, they have no value system that's interesting except fear of others. And those others are going to be a majority. So wake up.""
Newsom also said the current political climate has only bred fear and anxiety and accused Trump of selling voters a bill of goods.
""We're actually ginning up more anxiety, more fear -- which makes communities less safe,"" he said.
""I mean they're getting a completely raw deal. They've been sold a complete bill of bulls--t. Excuse my language and forgive me... it's just a yarn of crap."""

In the memo, titled ""Initial Message to the Department,"" Esper wrote, ""As we continue to advance the Nation's security, let me reaffirm our path forward. The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives."" 
Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.
Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.
Esper said Monday the department's priorities would ""remain unchanged"" and everything the department did ""should support its stated objectives."" 
He then went on to explain ""three mutually reinforcing lines of effort"" used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""
In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the ""surest way to deter adversary aggression"" and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it's important to ""continue to build readiness to fight"" while ""modernizing key capabilities for future conflict."" 
Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners ""play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world."" He added that through continued engagement the country will ""grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability."" 
Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.
He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.
Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.
""Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,"" Esper wrote in the memo. ""This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive."" 
He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and ""always do the right thing."" 
""Together, we will remain the most ready and capable military force in the world, which is what our nation expects and deserves,"" Esper said.

Andrew and Karen Wilson, both now 59, were first introduced when they were ""practically forced"" together in school in 1971.
The couple was originally ""disappointed"" when they were told to sit next to each other in class -- because they ""were the two stragglers"" -- at Riversmead School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England.
After a year, the pair grew close, becoming friends, but ""nothing happened"" and they went their separate ways after finishing school in 1976.
But now, over four decades later Karen and Andrew have tied the knot after they reconnected with each other over Facebook.
""So it took a while, 45 years, before I finally got the courage to ask Karen out on a date, but I finally got my girl,"" Andrew said.
""I quite fancied Karen at school but was way to shy to say anything,"" he added.
Karen, meanwhile, said she didn't even know Andrew liked her.
""I always thought he was so well put together but little did I know he actually liked me and was making an effort with me,"" Karen said. ""In second term, Andrew decided he liked me and I didn't mind spending another term with him. But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.
""And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.""
After losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.
However, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.
The pair said they would often chat ""for hours"" until Andrew ""picked up the courage"" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.
However, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.
""We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,"" said Karen.
""We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.
""He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.
""It couldn't have gone any better. I think if I had actually met him the day we were supposed to meet, I would have been a nervous wreck. But because it was the day before, I got surprised.""
Andrew proposed to Karen in June 2018 in Paris. They married on June 22, and are now on their honeymoon in Italy.
""I just want to say to all the women out there because careful what you wish for, because wishes do come true,"" Karen said.
""If you are 30, 40 or 50 and haven't found the right man yet, don't worry. You have to give it time."""

After a year, the pair grew close, becoming friends, but ""nothing happened"" and they went their separate ways after finishing school in 1976.
But now, over four decades later Karen and Andrew have tied the knot after they reconnected with each other over Facebook.
""So it took a while, 45 years, before I finally got the courage to ask Karen out on a date, but I finally got my girl,"" Andrew said.
""I quite fancied Karen at school but was way to shy to say anything,"" he added.
Karen, meanwhile, said she didn't even know Andrew liked her.
""I always thought he was so well put together but little did I know he actually liked me and was making an effort with me,"" Karen said. ""In second term, Andrew decided he liked me and I didn't mind spending another term with him. But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.
""And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.""
After losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.
However, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.
The pair said they would often chat ""for hours"" until Andrew ""picked up the courage"" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.
However, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.
""We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,"" said Karen.
""We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.
""He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.
""It couldn't have gone any better. I think if I had actually met him the day we were supposed to meet, I would have been a nervous wreck. But because it was the day before, I got surprised.""
Andrew proposed to Karen in June 2018 in Paris. They married on June 22, and are now on their honeymoon in Italy.
""I just want to say to all the women out there because careful what you wish for, because wishes do come true,"" Karen said.
""If you are 30, 40 or 50 and haven't found the right man yet, don't worry. You have to give it time."""

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

But over the course of the last 66 million years, the region grew much hotter and drier as the whole continent shifted north toward the equator. Those forests slowly died, and the creatures within them had to find new homes. So they fled underground in many waves, evolving to survive in their radically changed environments.
That's the story told in a new paper based on a genetic study of those strange arachnids. The critters, very distant cousins of spiders and scorpions, are found all over the world. But only in Western Australia's Pilbara region do they turn up underground. The researchers describe 56 newfound species in their study, an incredibly diverse group for such a small area.
""We think there are likely to be a lot more species out there, because they have such small distributions ... and we've only been able to sample a few places,"" lead researcher Kym Abrams, a biologist at The University of Western Australia, said in a statement. [Goliath Birdeater: Images of a Colossal Spider]
Usually, when researchers run across previously unknown subterranean schizomids, she said, it's during an environmental survey of the sort typically conducted before major construction projects.
That diversity of these species, Abrams and her team wrote in the paper, likely resulted from how splintered the species became as the region dried out. Eyeless schizomids are blind, and so they use their long forelegs to tap around their environments, almost like someone using a cane. And individual species all over the world tend to occupy relatively small areas.
But as Australia's dried-out west forced these Pilbara critters underground, the arachnids appear to have become even more isolated from one another, separated by long stretches of cooked land. And once isolated, each cluster of schizomids was free to evolve along its own path, a bit like if they'd each been dropped on different Pacific islands.
Biologists had long wondered, the team wrote, whether Australian subterranean schizomids had all descended from a single species that traveled below the surface all at once, or whether the creatures dropped into the dirty depths in waves. This research, the scientists wrote, suggests that even though all 56 species behave similarly -- all but one type live their entire lives underground, never emerging to the surface where their ancestors lived -- they're descended from different waves of subterranean pioneers.
Once underground, the descendants of those pioneers got further separated from one another, evolving separately into an even wider variety of species.
This research was published online as part of the upcoming October issue of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.
""Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,"" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family."

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.

Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""

The teenager died after an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette. 
Under ""Natasha's law"", food businesses will have to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food. 
Natasha's parents said ""helping save other allergy sufferers and their families from the enduring agony that we will always bear is a fitting legacy for her life.""
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the couple were an ""inspiration"". 
""These changes will make food labels clear and consistent and give the country's two million food allergy sufferers confidence in making safe food choices,"" he said. 
The law, which will apply to England and Northern Ireland, is set to come into force by the summer of 2021.
Businesses will be given a two-year implementation period to adapt to the changes. 
Natasha, 15, suffered a severe allergic reaction after eating sesame in an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought in Heathrow Airport.
She died of anaphylaxis after collapsing on board a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016.
The coroner looking into her death said Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging.
Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"" and said it would be listing all ingredients on its freshly made food.
A spokesman said: ""Full ingredient labels are now in over 60 Pret shops as part of our nationwide rollout. 
""Before we took this step, we ran a number of pilots to confirm that this approach would be safe, practical and effective.

He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

For better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.
Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.
A Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the ""lavish lifestyle"" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.
David Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.
""Horse manure,"" Lammy wrote on Twitter. ""What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?""
Collins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.
Facebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday."

The plan worked, but created another problem: Oregon now has way more pot than its 4 million residents can ever possibly hope to smoke. 
According to a 2019 Oregon Liquor Control Commission report, there are about 2,100 grower licensees in the state with enough weed currently on the market that it would take an estimated 6.5 years to sell it all within Oregon without any more production. The glut of marijuana has driven the price of marijuana down and left Oregonians wondering how they'll handle the weed windfall. 
In an attempt to remedy the state's cannabis conundrum, lawmakers in Oregon signed off on two news bills in the last week that would, respectively, cut down on excessive cultivation of marijuana and find new markets for the state's budding pot industry. 
Senate Bill 218 hands the Oregon Liquor Control Board more authority in issuing new licenses to growers based on the supply and demand for weed, while Senate Bill 582 lays the groundwork to eventually allow the governor to enter into agreements with other states for the importing and exporting of marijuana. 
It is currently illegal to transport marijuana across state borders so any moves from the governor's mansion in Salem would have to wait until lawmakers in Washington D.C. decide to make drastic changes to the nation's drug laws - a situation that seems unlikely given the Trump administration's less-than-friendly stance toward legal marijuana.
Currently recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and medical marijuana is legal in 33, and marijuana advocates argue that states like Oregon wouldn't be running into this surplus issue if the substance were permitted to be shipped out of state.
""You have people using water in the desert in Nevada to grow mediocre cannabis, or in Florida, where they have to dehumidify giant spaces, consuming twice the energy,"" Adam J.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""

The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously.

Barry Postman, Woods' attorney, said in a statement obtained by Fox News that the decision by Nicholas Immesberger's parents to drop Woods from the suit was ""clearly appropriate.""
""While the situation was tragic, the facts will ultimately show that the cause of Mr. Immesberger's car accident were the many decisions made by Mr. Immesberger on the night of his passing,"" the statement read.
The lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County last month alleged that before the crash, Immesberger, a bartender at The Woods in Jupiter, Fla., was over-served for about three hours after his shift at the restaurant was over.
Woods is an investor in the restaurant. His girlfriend, Erica Herman, the general manager, is still named in the suit, along with the restaurant, The Washington Post reported.
The amdended suit claims that Herman recruited Immesberger as a bartender there despite knowing he was an alcoholic. It alleges restaurant employees, managers and owners let Immesberger drive after being over-served alcohol.
The initial lawsuit claimed, ""Tiger knew, or reasonably should have known, that Immesberger was habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages, and/or was a habitual drunkard.""
The amended lawsuit--filed last week by the parents--no longer names Woods.

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

""It is just incredibly troubling,"" he said.
""We have a humanitarian crisis at our border. We've got families and kids flooding across our border in unprecedented numbers,"" he said.
Azar said HHS shelters are at capacity and the budget is not there to increase it unless Congress acts.
""We're full and we're running out of money. We need this money to take care of these kids,"" he said. ""I can't put a kid in a bed that does not exist and I cannot make a bed that Congress doesn't fund.""
Host Laura Ingraham asked Azar about comments 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro made about funding the border shelters.
""I wouldn't give them one more dime for these types of conditions,"" Castro told CNN anchor Jake Tapper.
""I don't have confidence that if you give them more money right now, if they have a plan to actually you know, different conditions...""

Rapinoe put the ball in the back of the net in the seventh minute of the match and then scored the second penalty in the 76th minute of the match - a pivotal moment for the U.S., who were under massive pressure by the attack-minding Spanish team. The American beat Spain 2-1.
The U.S. allowed their first goal of the Women's World Cup - and the first goal since April - in the ninth minute of the match when Jennifer Hermoso scored a lobbed kick over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. The U.S. had scored 18 straight goals in the World Cup before Hermoso's kick into the back of the net.
The U.S. win was the team's most challenging match up yet at the World Cup after flying past Thailand, Chile, and Sweden in the group stage. The team went up against a very physical Spanish team that committed 18 fouls against the U.S. and only received one yellow card. By comparison, the U.S. only committed four fouls and got one booking against Rapinoe.
However, two of the fouls proved to be detrimental as they occurred in the penalty box, giving the Americans ample opportunity to score against goalkeeper Sandra Panos.

""Hey Dad, I'm glad you asked. I've got a few ideas,"" Dante wrote to his father in the conversation that was shared. ""First of all, you're going to want to establish credibility, especially among skeptical young voters. Tell them the story of how you met mom... weave it into a reflection about how hard it is to find, like, 'the one' on tinder.""
The mayor wasn't impressed with his son's initial advice and informed him that he's looking for a universal message.
""Ah, ok,"" Dante responded. Well, in a time of unprecedented national division, one thing we can all agree on are dogs. You're going to want to build your platform and performance around them.""
Dante then told his father to bring photos or even a litter of puppies to the debate stage.
""That is definitely a creative approach... but how about something that allows me to stand out by talking about my accomplishments? I need to impress the American people,"" de Blasio told his son.
Dante told his father to tell people that New York City was ""just Staten Island"" when he started his first term.
The conversation continued with the mayor asking his son how to make his presence felt on the stage. Dante tells his father to ""leap over the moderator"" to dunk a basketball before they express love for each other.
The conversation was quickly mocked, with many people responding that he should fix the subways in New York City before worrying about a presidential bid.
""De Blasio's son Dante tells him to reference Tinder in Wednesday's debate in these totally real and definitely not staged texts,"" New York Daily News reporter Anna Sanders tweeted.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

That date hasn't been officially announced, but the rights to buy the car will be auctioned on Friday, June 28, at the Barrett-Jackson event in Connecticut.
The landmark car is set to be a black Z06 coupe with a 7-speed manual transmission, red interior and equipped with the top of the line 3LZ trim that will be represented by an identical stand-in Corvette at the auction.
All of the proceeds are earmarked for the Steven Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation to help support first responders and injured service members, and there should be plenty.
The first current-generation Z06 was auctioned for charity in 2015 and received a high bid of $1 million from NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick, who has amassed a large collection of historically significant Chevrolets.
Chevrolet officially confirmed the mid-engine model for 2020 at a fundraiser for the Siller foundation in April and will unveil it on July 18.
The automaker reportedly stopped taking special orders for current Corvettes on June 23, so the last car should be rolling off the line in the coming weeks."

Burhan - not his real name - arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry, aged 16. 
But authorities did not believe he was a child and instead placed him into the adult system, where he says he was attacked.
He is one of 137 child asylum seekers - identified by Newsnight - that have been wrongly classified as adults. 
Between January 2018 and March 2019, these children were sent into adult accommodation, only for authorities to later accept they had been telling the truth about their age. 
Using the Freedom of Information act, Newsnight identified 26 cases in Derby, and 29 in Cardiff. Another nine were identified in Birmingham, 56 in Liverpool, eight in Croydon, seven in Wakefield and two in Glasgow. 
These cities are the UK's seven regional hubs for processing asylum seekers.
Burhan - whose identity Newsnight is protecting - is from a troubled area of the Middle East. 
""I was in the lorry for three days. I had no food and only a little water, which ran out quickly,"" he said.
""When I got off the lorry, I went to a petrol station and asked for the police.""
Burhan was originally treated as a child, but then social services visited him to say they believed he was in fact 20, not 16. 
""I said 'no - you're wrong',"" Burhan recalled. ""They said if you don't go, we will call the police and the police will take you by force.
""I felt so powerless because no matter how many times I explained to them, they didn't want to believe me.""
Classed as an adult asylum seeker, he was sent to live in a room in a house with other asylum seekers, older than him. 
It was there, Burhan said, an older man kicked his bedroom door down and attacked him.
""He had a plate in his hand and he smashed it on my head,"" he said. ""My eyesight was blurry and I couldn't see. He brought out a knife... he lunged at me, but I managed to avoid it and ran away.
""I was very scared and I was shivering. I ran away with no clothes on, not even shoes. I only came back after the police had arrested him.""
In 2018, almost 3,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers arrived in the UK claiming to be under 18. It's widely accepted that some will be adults posing as children.
Last year, man who posed as a 15-year-old in Ipswich was thought to be as old as 30.
If asylum seekers are deemed to be children, they have more access to education and a better chance of being allowed to settle in the UK. 
After eight months, Burhan's case was reviewed by independent social care workers and it was judged that he was a child. 
""When they said I was a child, it was mixed feelings. I was happy that finally somebody believed me but I was upset that they wasted my time and they made me feel terrible,"" Burhan said. 
He is now learning English at college and is staying in appropriate accommodation. 
Labour Peer and former refugee Lord Dubs told Newsnight that cases such as Burhan's, when the Home Office does not believe someone is a child, are the ""harshest"".
""This is not helped by the fact that refugees have often been scrutinised by the media for looking older,"" he added.  
""We must not forget that these people have been on terrific journeys, and that they therefore probably look older given what they have endured."" 
In May, a case was brought before the Court of Appeal and judges ruled the process by which age was assessed was unlawful. 
Now, anyone appearing under the age of 25 will be referred to specialist local authority age assessors. 
The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by this judgement. 
""We take our duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the asylum and immigration system very seriously. However, age assessment is an extremely difficult area of work and is not an exact science,"" a Home Office spokesman said.
""Our approach seeks to strike an important but sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are appropriately supported whilst at the same time maintaining the integrity of the asylum system and preventing adults passing themselves off as children."""

Burhan - not his real name - arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry, aged 16. 
But authorities did not believe he was a child and instead placed him into the adult system, where he says he was attacked.
He is one of 137 child asylum seekers - identified by Newsnight - that have been wrongly classified as adults. 
Between January 2018 and March 2019, these children were sent into adult accommodation, only for authorities to later accept they had been telling the truth about their age. 
Using the Freedom of Information act, Newsnight identified 26 cases in Derby, and 29 in Cardiff. Another nine were identified in Birmingham, 56 in Liverpool, eight in Croydon, seven in Wakefield and two in Glasgow. 
These cities are the UK's seven regional hubs for processing asylum seekers.
Burhan - whose identity Newsnight is protecting - is from a troubled area of the Middle East. 
""I was in the lorry for three days. I had no food and only a little water, which ran out quickly,"" he said.
""When I got off the lorry, I went to a petrol station and asked for the police.""
Burhan was originally treated as a child, but then social services visited him to say they believed he was in fact 20, not 16. 
""I said 'no - you're wrong',"" Burhan recalled. ""They said if you don't go, we will call the police and the police will take you by force.
""I felt so powerless because no matter how many times I explained to them, they didn't want to believe me.""
Classed as an adult asylum seeker, he was sent to live in a room in a house with other asylum seekers, older than him. 
It was there, Burhan said, an older man kicked his bedroom door down and attacked him.
""He had a plate in his hand and he smashed it on my head,"" he said. ""My eyesight was blurry and I couldn't see. He brought out a knife... he lunged at me, but I managed to avoid it and ran away.
""I was very scared and I was shivering. I ran away with no clothes on, not even shoes. I only came back after the police had arrested him.""
In 2018, almost 3,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers arrived in the UK claiming to be under 18. It's widely accepted that some will be adults posing as children.
Last year, man who posed as a 15-year-old in Ipswich was thought to be as old as 30.
If asylum seekers are deemed to be children, they have more access to education and a better chance of being allowed to settle in the UK. 
After eight months, Burhan's case was reviewed by independent social care workers and it was judged that he was a child. 
""When they said I was a child, it was mixed feelings. I was happy that finally somebody believed me but I was upset that they wasted my time and they made me feel terrible,"" Burhan said. 
He is now learning English at college and is staying in appropriate accommodation. 
Labour Peer and former refugee Lord Dubs told Newsnight that cases such as Burhan's, when the Home Office does not believe someone is a child, are the ""harshest"".
""This is not helped by the fact that refugees have often been scrutinised by the media for looking older,"" he added.  
""We must not forget that these people have been on terrific journeys, and that they therefore probably look older given what they have endured."" 
In May, a case was brought before the Court of Appeal and judges ruled the process by which age was assessed was unlawful. 
Now, anyone appearing under the age of 25 will be referred to specialist local authority age assessors. 
The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by this judgement.

One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat.

""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""

""Note her typical emotional ploy, using children to get her way. Except when she wants their lives ended,"" Ingraham said on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Monday in response to a clip of Pelosi taking credit for delaying President Trump's ICE raids.
""When I spoke to the President, I said 'Look, I'm a mom, I have five kids, seven, nine grandchildren and children are scared,'""Pelosi said Monday in New York.
""No one wants any child ever to be afraid, ever. It is tragic, and it really shouldn't happen. And kids of American criminals, they suffer here too because of the mistakes of their parents. And parents coming illegally, again tragic but now comes the consequences for the whole family sometimes. Or at least there should be consequences if the rule of law means anything,"" Ingraham told her audience.
The host criticized Pelosi for not taking care of American citizens first and used San Francisco as an example.
""Nancy doesn't need to go far, does she, from San Francisco to see suffering and desperation. We have seen all those stories. Maybe she should focus on fixing that before throwing rocks,"" Ingraham said.
Ingraham also blasted Democrats for remaining silent on the issue when former President Obama faced the same accusations.
""But where were the Democrats? Where were their outrage before Trump came into office?"" Ingram said before playing a clip of Obama.
""Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they will get sent back, more importantly, they may not make it,"" President Obama said in 2014 interview with ABC News.

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.
The logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.
The argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.
Therefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.
Although the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.
Free college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Yes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.
According to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.
A challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.
Doubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.
A second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.
Although college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.
The way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.
These disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.
For example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.
Instead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, ""Choosing College,"" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.
Policymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.
College will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment."

""2020 Democrats are ramping up their radicalism. They want to be the most radical. Let me be clear, what we're witnessing from this new extreme socialist Democratic Party, this is beyond socialism even, it is unhinged,"" Hannity said on his television show Monday. ""It is beyond impractical. It is divisive and destructive to the country.""
Hannity played a multitude of clips highlighting what he felt were the more extreme elements the Democratic presidential candidates were promising and he went after South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg who has been criticized over his handling of a police officer shooting a African-American man, highlighting racial tensions in the city.
""Buttigieg has been a total absentee mayor and a failure,"" Hannity said. ""He's hardly ever in South Bend.""
Hannity  warned his viewers the that Democrats have moved even further left and want to take the country in a direction beyond even what the Obama administration had wanted to.
""Instead of sticking to any principles real agenda real policy that will help the forgotten men and women that got destroyed under the Biden-Obama economy, the extreme left now has gone further out to the fringe pandering to every corner of the Democratic Party,"" Hannity said.

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security."

For eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. With the United States needing a tougher posture against Iran and confronting renewed challenges in Asia and Europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure America has the carriers it needs.
The requirement to maintain carrier presence in the Middle East is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which U.S. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.
Indeed, the Navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the Cold War, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.
During the Obama administration, a ""rebalance"" supposedly allowed the Pentagon to focus on Asia and Europe while washing its hands of the Middle East. In reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the Asia-Pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the Middle East.
Now with a growing Iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.
This also places Tehran's proxies on the borders of key U.S. allies. Beginning next year, Tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as U.N. arms embargoes expire. It is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent Tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.
Credible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for American policymakers.
Last month's intelligence suggesting Iran was ready to move against U.S. interests in the Middle East demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden Iran. Responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group into the region has dramatically increased the U.S. force posture. Effective deterrence of Iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.
A combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.
Most fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in U.S. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission late last year.
At minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. The decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman two decades early.
But only sustained political will from both the administration and Congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the ""Navy the Nation Needs.""
Working with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.
These changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.
In the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.
Currently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.
The will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.
American policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. The U.S. Navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability."

""I can tell you that John Durham and Attorney General Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" he said.
""They are including in part of their surveillance - really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who joined Meadows on ""Hannity,"" added he agreed with the North Carolina lawmaker and that a previous report by the Justice Department's inspector general was fruitful.
""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation,"" he said. ""They have told us this is broader than just the FBI - they're going to look at all of this.
""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.
""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""
As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""
Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, led by Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services.""
Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.

Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

Bethlehem is Jesus' birthplace, according to Christian tradition. The font is estimated to date back to between 501 and 600 A.D.
Ziad al-Bandak, head of a Palestinian presidential committee leading the church renovation, said Saturday that international experts are arriving in the biblical West Bank town to examine the receptacle.
Al-Bandak described the Byzantine font as a ""magnificent"" discovery that had been covered by the larger known vessel.
A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Church of the Nativity is located about 6.2 miles south of Jerusalem. The church is built on the site identified as Jesus' birthplace by Christian tradition.
A restoration project was launched five years ago to overcome decades of neglect at the historic church.
Palestinian news agency WAFA reports that a ceremony to celebrate the end of the restoration project, which was planned for November, has been pushed back to May 2020. The postponement will allow the three churches in charge of the Church of the Nativity to undertake a restoration of the church's grotto, WAFA reports.
In a separate project at the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, archaeologists have been hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.

The International Olympic Committee on Monday voted to hold the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.
Italy won the bid over Stockholm-Are, of Sweden, to host the Winter Games. It'll be the first time the Games will be held in Italy since Turin hosted in 2006.
Cortina d'Ampezzo, a ski town in northern Italy, hosted the Olympics in 1956. Sweden has never hosted the Winter Games, but Stockholm was the host of the 1912 Summer Games.
Both Italy and Sweden's bids made their final pitches to the IOC on Monday during a nine-hour meeting to choose a winner.
In their final presentations to win the bid from the IOC, the prime ministers of Italy and Sweden both pushed for their nations to host the 2026 games.
Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, noted that support in Italy is strong for an Olympic Games, and was a focal point of their bid. His presentation highlighted how 83 percent of the Italian population is in favor of the games, with 87 percent rising in Milan.
He said: ""If I am here today in front of you, it is thanks to the enthusiasm of all Italy. ... This is the dream of an entire country, and not only the government but also the regions.""
Sweden Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""it's in our DNA"" to deliver a stable Winter Games after the IOC's own polling determined there was around 60 percent public backing in Sweden to host the games. The bid was challenged to prove its support from a Stockholm city authority coalition formed last October and a national government only five months ago.
The mayor of Stockholm, Anna Konig Jerlmyr, played up ABBA -- Sweden's most famous musical act -- telling the committee: ""ABBA is everywhere."" She then broke out into her own rendition of ""Dancing Queen.""

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

Following the president's last-minute decision last week to call off a military strike that he claimed would have killed about 150 people, the White House announced that Iran will face additional ""hard-hitting"" sanctions that will specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.
Appearing on ""CNN Tonight,"" Zakaria struggled to answer whether President Trump did the right thing by calling off the strike because of the apparent dangers of the sanctions.
""The sanctions that are in place in Iran probably- I haven't done the calculations, but I think it's fair to say almost certainly will kill several hundred, maybe thousands of people over the next few months in terms of depriving people of medical supplies, food, nutrition,"" Zakaria said. ""And when you do a military strike, the people you are killing will tend to be Iranian soldiers, military officers who are volunteering to take park in Iran's military struggle. The people you kill when you impose sanctions are the most vulnerable in society. These are the poorest people, the sickest people.""
He continued, ""So if that's his concern, he seems almost gleeful about the idea of imposing more and more sanctions on Iran. Has he thought about the human cost of this? I don't think so.""
The CNN host went on to blast the ""weird, impulse-driven policy"" on Iran and questioned whether there were ""any grownups in the White House"" for naming the wrong ayatollah in their announcement of the new sanctions."

President Trump revealed last week that he called off the strike against Iran following them shooting down a U.S. drone roughly ten minutes before the strike was set to launch after he learned that roughly 150 Iranians would have been killed.
""If Trump had taken military action, I would have come down hard on him,"" Matthews told the panel Monday evening. ""I think it's good that he hesitated. I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.""
The ""Hardball"" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died ""weren't the bad guys.""
""The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,"" Matthews elaborated.
""We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.""

St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued  to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis time to take a licensing fight to perform abortions before an administrative panel.
Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside of court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.
TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS
The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.
""We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
She said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, ""abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.""
Republican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.
""We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,"" he said in a statement.
The fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.
The state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three ""failed abortions"" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.
Missouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.

The number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""

Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

In an Instagram post early Monday, Jackson reposted a photo of two side-by-side posters promoting his upcoming film ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" which depicted his character, Nick Fury, with his signature eye patch placed on two different eyes, rather than only the correct left eye.
""Uhhhhhhh, What In The Actual F-- IS GOING ON HERE???!!!,"" the actor captioned the picture, adding the hashtags, ""#headsgonroll #lefteyemuthafu--ah.""
The original photo was initially posted by an observant Marvel fan on Reddit, with the humorous title, ""Which eye did he injure?""
One Reddit user jokingly claimed, ""All this time Nick Fury has just been defrauding the government for disability.""
Another user quipped, ""Obviously, one of the pictures is actually a selfie which is why it's flipped compared to the other.""
Jackson's character of Nick Fury has remained a staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ever since his debut in the first ""Iron Man"" film in 2008. The origin of Fury's iconic eyepatch was revealed during a scene in the recent ""Captain Marvel,"" when Fury's eye was scratched by the film's fan-favorite cat, Goose.
""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" hits theaters July 2 and stars Jackson with main actor Tom Holland as Spider-Man, as well as Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

However, the former foreign secretary and London mayor has spoken to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, defending his Brexit plans and decision not to speak about the widely reported row between himself and his partner Carrie Symonds.
He said he did not believe ""for a moment"" that the UK would leave the EU without a deal, although he was willing for it to happen if necessary. Mr Johnson also said the EU would have to co-operate to avoid a hard Irish border.
On his personal life, he refused to describe what had happened with Ms Symonds in the early hours of last Friday, saying: ""I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones.""

The government is to introduce a law forcing businesses to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food. This follows the death in 2016 of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse after an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette. Her parents, Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who have campaigned for changes to the law, said they were ""delighted"". ""Natasha's Law"" is set to come into force in England and Northern Ireland by summer 2021.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

""She missed a midterm exam and a flight and at this time there is no evidence that any harm has come to her, however, because of the circumstances of the case we want to make sure that she is alright."" 
Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.
""Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,"" Doubt said on Monday. 
He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said. ""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""
Lueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.
""Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,"" Doubt said.

""To date her family and her friends have not heard from her,"" Salt Lake City Police Assistant Chief Tim Doubt told reporters on Monday. 
""She missed a midterm exam and a flight and at this time there is no evidence that any harm has come to her, however, because of the circumstances of the case we want to make sure that she is alright."" 
Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.
""Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,"" Doubt said on Monday. 
He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said. ""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""
Lueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.
""Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,"" Doubt said. ""We just want to make sure you are safe and we will respect your wishes.""

The 54-year-old model brightened up the day of her social media followers on Sunday when she shared a stunning shot to Instagram.
Captioned ""Sunshine Bikini for gloriously sunny LA,"" Hurley glowed as she rocked a yellow bikini top with a deep neckline, which she accented with heart-shaped sunglasses.
Hurley has been on a tear since ringing in her 54th birthday just two weeks ago. The mother of Damian Hurley -- an actor and budding fashion model himself -- has remained one of the industry's leading age-defying women and recently spilled the beans on how she remains in top shape.
""I think we have to stay active, whether it's formal exercise or just moving around a lot,"" the British model told Closer Weekly last month. ""I think we have to watch what we eat. We all know that. Everybody tells us that, but we have to watch what we eat.""
But while the Estee Lauder model admitted she isn't keen on partaking in diet fads, Hurley can't help herself when it comes to topping off her plate with a heap of vegetables -- something she said has helped her figure immensely over the years.
""I eat meat and fish, but I also eat a lot of vegetables, and I've been really trying in the last year that 50 percent of the foods I eat are vegetables,"" she told the outlet. ""It's not easy but I'm trying -- and I think it really makes a difference actually.""
Earlier this month, it was also revealed that the actress will be starring in the third season of ""Runaways"" on Hulu, according to Variety. The actress will be playing villain Morgan le Fay on the Marvel series, the outlet reported.

Mexico promised earlier this month to send 6,500 National Guard agents to its southern border, but Monday's announcement was the first public acknowledgment of deployments to the U.S. border.
At a news conference in the Caribbean city of Cancun, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican forces were detaining migrants to prevent them from crossing the U.S. border. Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.
""Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,"" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.
Mexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.
Nuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.
Previous rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.
""It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,"" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. ""The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion). We will continue knocking on doors to find resources. The municipal government is overwhelmed.""
Rivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.
Thomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.
There have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.
Fifth-ranked Canada, which finished second in its group after a 2-1 loss to the Dutch, has bronze medals in the last two Olympics but fell to England in the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup on home soil."

The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. 
He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". 
Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need.""
""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added.
Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. 
""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said.
""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. 
Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. 
The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. 
The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. 
His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.
There has not been a full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities, since 2015 and one is expected in 2020."

Rapinoe put the ball in the back of the net in the seventh minute of the match and then scored the second penalty in the 76th minute of the match - a pivotal moment for the U.S., who were under massive pressure by the attack-minding Spanish team. The American beat Spain 2-1.
The U.S. allowed their first goal of the Women's World Cup - and the first goal since April - in the ninth minute of the match when Jennifer Hermoso scored a lobbed kick over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. The U.S. had scored 18 straight goals in the World Cup before Hermoso's kick into the back of the net.
The U.S. win was the team's most challenging match up yet at the World Cup after flying past Thailand, Chile, and Sweden in the group stage. The team went up against a very physical Spanish team that committed 18 fouls against the U.S. and only received one yellow card. By comparison, the U.S. only committed four fouls and got one booking against Rapinoe.

Rapinoe put the ball in the back of the net in the seventh minute of the match and then scored the second penalty in the 76th minute of the match - a pivotal moment for the U.S., who were under massive pressure by the attack-minding Spanish team. The American beat Spain 2-1.
The U.S. allowed their first goal of the Women's World Cup - and the first goal since April - in the ninth minute of the match when Jennifer Hermoso scored a lobbed kick over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. The U.S. had scored 18 straight goals in the World Cup before Hermoso's kick into the back of the net.
The U.S. win was the team's most challenging match up yet at the World Cup after flying past Thailand, Chile, and Sweden in the group stage. The team went up against a very physical Spanish team that committed 18 fouls against the U.S. and only received one yellow card. By comparison, the U.S. only committed four fouls and got one booking against Rapinoe.

The WhatsApp conversation beings with de Blasio admitting he's a ""little nervous"" about the upcoming Democratic primary debate and asking his son for advice. De Blasio is schduled to partake in the first of two-night NBC debate on Wednesday.
""Hey Dad, I'm glad you asked. I've got a few ideas,"" Dante wrote to his father in the conversation that was shared. ""First of all, you're going to want to establish credibility, especially among skeptical young voters. Tell them the story of how you met mom... weave it into a reflection about how hard it is to find, like, 'the one' on tinder.""
The mayor wasn't impressed with his son's initial advice and informed him that he's looking for a universal message.
""Ah, ok,"" Dante responded. Well, in a time of unprecedented national division, one thing we can all agree on are dogs. You're going to want to build your platform and performance around them.""
Dante then told his father to bring photos or even a litter of puppies to the debate stage.
""That is definitely a creative approach... but how about something that allows me to stand out by talking about my accomplishments? I need to impress the American people,"" de Blasio told his son.
Dante told his father to tell people that New York City was ""just Staten Island"" when he started his first term.
The conversation continued with the mayor asking his son how to make his presence felt on the stage. Dante tells his father to ""leap over the moderator"" to dunk a basketball before they express love for each other.
The conversation was quickly mocked, with many people responding that he should fix the subways in New York City before worrying about a presidential bid.
""De Blasio's son Dante tells him to reference Tinder in Wednesday's debate in these totally real and definitely not staged texts,"" New York Daily News reporter Anna Sanders tweeted.
CNN's Ana Navarro asked if it was a parody account, while New York Post reporter Jon Levine sarcastically wrote, ""Just totally normal dad-son banter here."""

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

Mexico promised earlier this month to send 6,500 National Guard agents to its southern border, but Monday's announcement was the first public acknowledgment of deployments to the U.S. border.
At a news conference in the Caribbean city of Cancun, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican forces were detaining migrants to prevent them from crossing the U.S. border. Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.
""Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,"" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.
Mexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.
Nuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.
Previous rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.
""It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,"" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press.

Rivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.
Thomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.
There have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.

The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

""2020 Democrats are ramping up their radicalism. They want to be the most radical. Let me be clear, what we're witnessing from this new extreme socialist Democratic Party, this is beyond socialism even, it is unhinged,"" Hannity said on his television show Monday. ""It is beyond impractical. It is divisive and destructive to the country.""
Hannity played a multitude of clips highlighting what he felt were the more extreme elements the Democratic presidential candidates were promising and he went after South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg who has been criticized over his handling of a police officer shooting a African-American man, highlighting racial tensions in the city.
""Buttigieg has been a total absentee mayor and a failure,"" Hannity said. ""He's hardly ever in South Bend.""
Hannity  warned his viewers the that Democrats have moved even further left and want to take the country in a direction beyond even what the Obama administration had wanted to.
""Instead of sticking to any principles real agenda real policy that will help the forgotten men and women that got destroyed under the Biden-Obama economy, the extreme left now has gone further out to the fringe pandering to every corner of the Democratic Party,"" Hannity said.
The host blasted candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for supporting reparations for gay Americans and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for saying he would meet with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
""Of course specifics aren't a priority for the new radical Democrats and they're not going to tell us how to pay for anything they'll say and do anything to try and get elected, to take away every person's fear with false promises and lies that really are about their power,"" Hannity said,"

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

The printing is on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia through the end of 2019. This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.
Printed by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col. David Mulford, a Revolutionary War colonel who died of smallpox in 1778. The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.
""The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,"" said Kinyon in a statement. ""Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.""
""We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,"" said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, President and CEO of the Museum of the American Revolution. ""It is humbling to stand in the presence of such an authentic witness to our nation's birth.""
Revolutionary War artifacts offer a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America. Items in the Museum of the American Revolution's collection include George Washington's tent and his headquarters flag.
In December 2018, the remains of the famous Revolutionary War frigate USS Bonhomme Richard were discovered off the coast of the U.K., more than 200 years after it sank following a naval battle.
Earlier this year, a rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War went on display at the Museum of the American Revolution.

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.
""The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians."""

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

The CNN host went on to blast the ""weird, impulse-driven policy"" on Iran and questioned whether there were ""any grownups in the White House"" for naming the wrong ayatollah in their announcement of the new sanctions."

Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House.""

The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.

The U.S. and Iran have seen tensions increase exponentially in the past few weeks after an initial U.S. sanctions squeeze that Washington said led to the attacks on two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.
Abbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means ""closing channel of diplomacy forever,"" according to Reuters. 
""Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,"" the tweet read.
John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is ""walk through that open door."" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.
Trump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his ""restraint"" is not limitless.
Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions ""lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.""
Fox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

For the current second tier, this may represent an opportunity for them to break out from a pack whose sheer size - and intense national schedule - makes this year more challenging for what we might charitably call campaign ""asterisks."" For the front runners and top tier challengers, these nights represent real risks of a blooper that could derail any of them, or an opportunity to address - directly - issues that have been raised about them.
The ""card"" for each night features ten candidates for two hours - with a panel of five NBC moderators. To limit size, the moderators will tag team, so each hour will have thirteen people on stage.
I reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:
My bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected ""bites.""
Sanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum. In 2016, against Hillary Clinton, he was easily able to represent the more progressive ranks of the party. But with Warren feeding a stream of detailed progressive plans, that's harder. His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his ""Democratic Socialist"" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.
Harris has often slipped in unscripted settings, but she continues to be formidable in fund raising. She needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.
My bet for both nights: While the also-rans will seek attention, their sheer volume will enable each of the top front runners to maintain their status, and the race will continue to be a five-way campaign among Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg."

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Connecticut federal prosecutor John Durham is looking closely at the intelligence community's activity in late 2016 and early 2017, the House Freedom Caucus chairman claimed on ""Hannity.""
""I can tell you that John Durham and Attorney General Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" he said.
""They are including in part of their surveillance - really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who joined Meadows on ""Hannity,"" added he agreed with the North Carolina lawmaker and that a previous report by the Justice Department's inspector general was fruitful.
""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation,"" he said. ""They have told us this is broader than just the FBI - they're going to look at all of this.
""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.

Rivera suggested Buttigieg's candidacy is likely to end in South Carolina after the recent controversy.
""It seems to me that unless he can turn this around, his candidacy will hit South Carolina and end there, seems to me. He's not being accepted by the African-American community,"" Rivera said.
Williams agreed with Rivera's assessment, saying Buttigieg is looking like he's ""small town mayor"" -- not presidential.

 ""I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor. If he doesn't deal with this crises, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation,"" Williams said.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added.

Truitt had been working with his stepdad at a home in Livonia when a metal ladder he was carrying touched a live electrical wire. He said he doesn't remember anything past that, but the homeowner called 911 and started CPR. It took about four minutes for paramedics to arrive and they attempted to revive him with the defibrillator while en route to the hospital, but he never regained a heartbeat in the ambulance.

""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

Hurley has been on a tear since ringing in her 54th birthday just two weeks ago. The mother of Damian Hurley -- an actor and budding fashion model himself -- has remained one of the industry's leading age-defying women and recently spilled the beans on how she remains in top shape.

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.
A Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the ""lavish lifestyle"" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.
David Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.
""Horse manure,"" Lammy wrote on Twitter. ""What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?""
Collins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.
Facebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday."

The printing is on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia through the end of 2019. This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.
Printed by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col. David Mulford, a Revolutionary War colonel who died of smallpox in 1778. The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.
""The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,"" said Kinyon in a statement. ""Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.""
""We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,"" said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, President and CEO of the Museum of the American Revolution. ""It is humbling to stand in the presence of such an authentic witness to our nation's birth.""
Revolutionary War artifacts offer a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America. Items in the Museum of the American Revolution's collection include George Washington's tent and his headquarters flag.
In December 2018, the remains of the famous Revolutionary War frigate USS Bonhomme Richard were discovered off the coast of the U.K., more than 200 years after it sank following a naval battle.
Earlier this year, a rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War went on display at the Museum of the American Revolution.

Azar characterized the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as dire, but said some accusations against his department's work in the area are not true, in a Monday interview on ""The Ingraham Angle.""
""It is just incredibly troubling,"" he said.
""We have a humanitarian crisis at our border. We've got families and kids flooding across our border in unprecedented numbers,"" he said.
Azar said HHS shelters are at capacity and the budget is not there to increase it unless Congress acts.
""We're full and we're running out of money. We need this money to take care of these kids,"" he said. ""I can't put a kid in a bed that does not exist and I cannot make a bed that Congress doesn't fund.""
Host Laura Ingraham asked Azar about comments 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro made about funding the border shelters.
""I wouldn't give them one more dime for these types of conditions,"" Castro told CNN anchor Jake Tapper.
""I don't have confidence that if you give them more money right now, if they have a plan to actually you know, different conditions...""
Azar pushed back on the Housing and Urban Development secretary's comments.
""What conditions are we talking about?"" he asked.
""We provide these kids some of the safest, most secure environments that some of these kids have unfortunately ever had.
""There is this false narrative that somehow we are trying to keep these kids with us for a long period of time. Our goal at HHS is to have these kids with us for zero days if we could. We don't want any kids in our care. We have actually decreased the average number of days the kids stay with us from over 90 days down to 44 days."""

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

Smith,PERSON,884556,8,1,"After legalizing marijuana in 2015, officials in Oregon began liberally doling out licenses to growers in an effort to shift sales away from the black market toward the now-legalized industry. 
The plan worked, but created another problem: Oregon now has way more pot than its 4 million residents can ever possibly hope to smoke. 
According to a 2019 Oregon Liquor Control Commission report, there are about 2,100 grower licensees in the state with enough weed currently on the market that it would take an estimated 6.5 years to sell it all within Oregon without any more production. The glut of marijuana has driven the price of marijuana down and left Oregonians wondering how they'll handle the weed windfall. 
In an attempt to remedy the state's cannabis conundrum, lawmakers in Oregon signed off on two news bills in the last week that would, respectively, cut down on excessive cultivation of marijuana and find new markets for the state's budding pot industry. 
Senate Bill 218 hands the Oregon Liquor Control Board more authority in issuing new licenses to growers based on the supply and demand for weed, while Senate Bill 582 lays the groundwork to eventually allow the governor to enter into agreements with other states for the importing and exporting of marijuana. 
It is currently illegal to transport marijuana across state borders so any moves from the governor's mansion in Salem would have to wait until lawmakers in Washington D.C. decide to make drastic changes to the nation's drug laws - a situation that seems unlikely given the Trump administration's less-than-friendly stance toward legal marijuana.
Currently recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and medical marijuana is legal in 33, and marijuana advocates argue that states like Oregon wouldn't be running into this surplus issue if the substance were permitted to be shipped out of state.
""You have people using water in the desert in Nevada to grow mediocre cannabis, or in Florida, where they have to dehumidify giant spaces, consuming twice the energy,"" Adam J. Smith, founder and director of the Craft Cannabis Alliance based in Oregon, told the Los Angeles Times. ""Oregon wouldn't have an oversupply problem if we could access legal markets like these."""

Mexico promised earlier this month to send 6,500 National Guard agents to its southern border, but Monday's announcement was the first public acknowledgment of deployments to the U.S. border.
At a news conference in the Caribbean city of Cancun, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican forces were detaining migrants to prevent them from crossing the U.S. border. Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.
""Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,"" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.
Mexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.
Nuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.
Previous rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.
""It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,"" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. ""The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion). We will continue knocking on doors to find resources. The municipal government is overwhelmed.""
Rivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.
Thomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.
There have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.

But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

The model who is originally from Toa Baja, on the outskirts of San Juan, Puerto Rico, immediately left behind her home in Los Angeles and her career to be by her family's side in 2017, when the devastating natural disaster hit the island with catastrophic results. She remained there as the island attempted to recover, as well as worked with Waves for Water, a nonprofit organization that installed handmade water filters throughout Puerto Rico.
Willing to pick up where she left off, Lara came back to Los Angeles in 2018. And two weeks after that, Playboy called. She would go on to return to Puerto Rico once more for an opportunity of a lifetime.
Lara spoke to Fox News about baring nearly all for the magazine, why she thinks the title of Playmate is inspiring, and how Hurricane Maria impacted her home.
All I could think about was going home and just being with my family. I know that jeopardized my career because I was already established, signed and working in Los Angeles. But I took a chance to help my people to make them feel like we had each other's back no matter what. When I did decide to make the jump and move back home, I felt like I was doing the right thing. I knew it was going to affect my career, but I also knew in my heart that's what I was meant to do."

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

Rapinoe put the ball in the back of the net in the seventh minute of the match and then scored the second penalty in the 76th minute of the match - a pivotal moment for the U.S., who were under massive pressure by the attack-minding Spanish team. The American beat Spain 2-1.
The U.S. allowed their first goal of the Women's World Cup - and the first goal since April - in the ninth minute of the match when Jennifer Hermoso scored a lobbed kick over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. The U.S. had scored 18 straight goals in the World Cup before Hermoso's kick into the back of the net.
The U.S. win was the team's most challenging match up yet at the World Cup after flying past Thailand, Chile, and Sweden in the group stage. The team went up against a very physical Spanish team that committed 18 fouls against the U.S. and only received one yellow card. By comparison, the U.S. only committed four fouls and got one booking against Rapinoe.
However, two of the fouls proved to be detrimental as they occurred in the penalty box, giving the Americans ample opportunity to score against goalkeeper Sandra Panos.
The U.S. faces World Cup host France in the next round. France is coming off a 2-1 win in extra time over Brazil."

The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. 
He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". 
Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need.""
""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added.
Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. 
""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said.
""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. 
Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. 
The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. 
The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. 
His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.
There has not been a full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities, since 2015 and one is expected in 2020."

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.
Fifth-ranked Canada, which finished second in its group after a 2-1 loss to the Dutch, has bronze medals in the last two Olympics but fell to England in the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup on home soil."

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday.

The tool, which was produced by researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute, can detect subtle face and head movements along with unique artifacts in video files, and apparently can identify such fakes with up to 96 percent accuracy.
Deepfakes, even amateurish ones like the widely circulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that was slowed down to make her appear drunk or senile, have become a growing concern and prompted a backlash against Big Tech for not doing enough to crack down on them.
Most deepfake detection models look at videos on a frame-by-frame basis to determine if they've been manipulated. However, the USC researchers review an entire video all at once and examine potential inconsistencies in how the subject in the footage moves -- which the researchers refer to as ""softbiometric signatures"" in their published work.
""To contend with this growing threat, we describe a forensic technique that models facial expressions and movements that typify an individual's speaking pattern. Although not visually apparent, these correlations are often violated by the nature of how deep-fake videos are created and can, therefore, be used for authentication,"" the researchers write in the study's abstract.
The scientists used a data set of about 1,000 manipulated videos to train its tool, which became adept at figuring out deepfakes of leading politicians and celebrities.
The issue of what do about deepfakes won't be going away anytime soon. Scientists last week revealed a software tool that literally allows you to put words into someone else's mouth."

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.
""The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians."""

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.
A Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the ""lavish lifestyle"" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.
David Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.
""Horse manure,"" Lammy wrote on Twitter. ""What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?""
Collins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.
Facebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday."

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.
Fifth-ranked Canada, which finished second in its group after a 2-1 loss to the Dutch, has bronze medals in the last two Olympics but fell to England in the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup on home soil."

Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer.

He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

The International Olympic Committee on Monday voted to hold the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.
Italy won the bid over Stockholm-Are, of Sweden, to host the Winter Games. It'll be the first time the Games will be held in Italy since Turin hosted in 2006.
Cortina d'Ampezzo, a ski town in northern Italy, hosted the Olympics in 1956. Sweden has never hosted the Winter Games, but Stockholm was the host of the 1912 Summer Games.
Both Italy and Sweden's bids made their final pitches to the IOC on Monday during a nine-hour meeting to choose a winner.
In their final presentations to win the bid from the IOC, the prime ministers of Italy and Sweden both pushed for their nations to host the 2026 games.
Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, noted that support in Italy is strong for an Olympic Games, and was a focal point of their bid. His presentation highlighted how 83 percent of the Italian population is in favor of the games, with 87 percent rising in Milan.
He said: ""If I am here today in front of you, it is thanks to the enthusiasm of all Italy. ... This is the dream of an entire country, and not only the government but also the regions.""
Sweden Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""it's in our DNA"" to deliver a stable Winter Games after the IOC's own polling determined there was around 60 percent public backing in Sweden to host the games. The bid was challenged to prove its support from a Stockholm city authority coalition formed last October and a national government only five months ago.
The mayor of Stockholm, Anna Konig Jerlmyr, played up ABBA -- Sweden's most famous musical act -- telling the committee: ""ABBA is everywhere."" She then broke out into her own rendition of ""Dancing Queen.""

In a recent interview with Fox News, President Trump made it clear that he has no intention of removing Conway.

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.
Fifth-ranked Canada, which finished second in its group after a 2-1 loss to the Dutch, has bronze medals in the last two Olympics but fell to England in the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup on home soil."

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.
The swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.
Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.
He and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: ""My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer."" He responds: ""Yeah. That's me.""
Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.
Christensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.
There are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.
Zhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

The printing is on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia through the end of 2019. This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.
Printed by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col. David Mulford, a Revolutionary War colonel who died of smallpox in 1778. The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.
""The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,"" said Kinyon in a statement. ""Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.""
""We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,"" said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, President and CEO of the Museum of the American Revolution. ""It is humbling to stand in the presence of such an authentic witness to our nation's birth.""
Revolutionary War artifacts offer a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America. Items in the Museum of the American Revolution's collection include George Washington's tent and his headquarters flag.
In December 2018, the remains of the famous Revolutionary War frigate USS Bonhomme Richard were discovered off the coast of the U.K., more than 200 years after it sank following a naval battle.
Earlier this year, a rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War went on display at the Museum of the American Revolution.

In most contests, the team having more fun, wins.
And the team that loses its sense of humor, loses - period.
Take Friday, when President Trump posted a meme predicting he'll be president for ever. And ever.
Normal people, i.e. people not in the media, and therefore not under the spell of irrational obsessions, saw this as light-hearted trolling, mocking the Triggered Trump Critics like this fella:
Bill Maher: ""If he loses, Trump, he won't go. I've been saying that since before he got elected.""
And he was a comedian - once.
It's so obvious it hurts. But still the media reports Trump's jokes as dire warnings.
Here's a Mediaite headline, screaming: ""Trump posts insane Twitter video threatening to be president for eternity.""
""Threatening.""
What moron writes this stuff? It's hard to say: they got a staff of them.
I'm anxiously awaiting their expose on why the chicken really crossed the road. Or does time really fly if you throw a clock through the air? I bet that gets three Pinocchios.
How did these people get so - to use the medical term - stupid?
Well, the media, once operating under the guise of journalism, are now just hall monitors and pundit-finks. Their job reduced to screaming ""look what someone said on TV! It's a joke - but not to us!""
They barely get out of bed anymore. Their workplace attire: sweatpants and an open bathrobe.
But that's today's media: reporting on you, as you make them the butt of the joke.  Like Chuck!
Chuck Todd: You've joked about a third term, you've joked about these things.
Trump: I only joke. I joke and say 'watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy.'
Chuck Todd: You will accept the result. And you will accept - whatever happens in 2020.
Trump: Sure.
Chuck Todd: You lose, you're gonna be - you're not gonna like it, but you'll walk out.
Trump: Sure. In fact, I said in a speech recently, I said 'watch, we'll drive the media crazy - let's go for a third term, and then a fourth,' and some of the media said 'he's going to do it!'
What a treat - the trolls reporting on how they got trolled. It's too easy, and almost unfair.
To think we're gonna have at least two, three, or four terms of this.

cc8bb0cb-0bf6-4135-a0f9-00ddfe9632ac,45298783,424085,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Luft,PERSON,831624,11,1,"Family and friends of missing Connecticut mother of five Jennifer Dulos on Monday countered a claim from her estranged husband's lawyer that the author was ""deeply troubled,"" and said any links to a book she wrote nearly two decades ago were way off base.
In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety.""

She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years.

Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""
""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

Lt. Daniel Mederos of the Nashua Police Department told the Associated Press that Officer Michael Kekejian was conducting a stop on Sunday when 24-year-old Oscar Alicea hopped into his car.
Kekejian leaped into the driver's seat on top of Alicea and ordered him out of the vehicle, only for the suspect to begin driving away with the door open. The officer and the suspect fought as the cruiser struck a fence and porch.
Police say Alicea bit the officer at one point during the struggle, which they said ""recklessly placed several pedestrians in the area as well as Officer Kekejian in danger.""
The two managed to drive around an intersection before hitting a park bench and coming to a stop.
Authorities say Kekejian was treated at a hospital and released after taking Alicea into custody.
WHDH reported that Alicea faces multiple felony charges, including reckless conduct, theft of a motor vehicle, assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and operating without a valid license."

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back."

In an interview, Trump was quizzed on his level of confidence in the FBI boss.
""Well, we'll see how it turns out,"" he told The Hill, before discussing Wray's previous claim that he would not use the word ""spying"" to describe the bureau's surveillance of figures linked to the Trump campaign in 2016.
""I mean, I disagree with him on that and I think a lot of people are disagreeing. You may even disagree with him on that.""
The comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.
""'The FBI has no leadership,'"" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. ""'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.' (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch.""
When asked earlier this year if he believed the Trump campaign was spied on in 2016, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee: ""That's not the term I would use.
""Lots of people have different colloquial phrases. I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me the key question is making sure that it's done by the book, consistent with our lawful authorities."""

Mutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Monday on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.
More than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.
Rebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.
Mutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.
""Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,"" he said.
""How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,"" he said. ""I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.""
The idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.
""We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,"" Redfield said.
Mutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.

Blacktenius scored in the 55th minute. Canada had a chance to pull even in the 69th but goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stopped Janine Beckie's penalty kick after a handball was called on Kosovare Asllani.
Ninth-ranked Sweden will face No. 2 Germany in a quarterfinal on Saturday in Rennes. Germany advanced to the quarterfinals for the eighth straight time, beating African champion Nigeria 3-0 on Saturday.
Sweden was eliminated with a 4-1 round of 16 loss to Germany four years ago at the World Cup in Canada.
Beckie took the penalty rather than captain Christine Sinclair, whose 182 goals remain two shy of matching the record set by retired American Abby Wambach.
Sinclair, who had a goal in Canada's final group stage match against the Netherlands, is the second player to score in five straight World Cups, joining Brazil's Marta. Eight of Sinclair's goals have come against Sweden.
Sweden finished second in its group behind the defending champion U.S. The Swedes wrapped up the group with a 2-0 loss to the Americans, who they famously knocked out of the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics.
Sweden has been to all eight World Cups since the women's tournament started in 1991. Its best finish was runner up in 2003.

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.
The logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.
The argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.
Therefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.
Although the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.
Free college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Yes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.
According to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.
A challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.
Doubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.
A second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.
Although college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.
The way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.
These disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.
For example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.
Instead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, ""Choosing College,"" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.
Policymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.
College will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment."

The fish was caught over the weekend in the waters off of Brigantine, NJ. A crowd gathered as the fisherman fought to reel in the amazing catch.
Fabiana Pons captured the scene on video and uploaded it to the internet. The footage shows the man struggling to control the large animal while others try to measure the beast. It has not been stated what type of shark it was, although based on the footage, it wasn't a happy kind of shark.
After showing off the catch, the fisherman released the shark back into the ocean.
This isn't the first shark to be sighted on the New Jersey coastline recently. Last week, a group of fisherman had a shocking encounter with a much larger shark in the waters off of New Jersey.
The group of five men was wrapping up after a day of fishing when they spotted the massive animal. It circled the boat several times before charging up and grabbing their chum bag with its mouth. This incident was also caught on camera and drew several comparisons to the 1975 movie ""Jaws."""

The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. 
He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". 
Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need.""
""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added.
Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. 
""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said.
""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. 
Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. 
The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. 
The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. 
His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.
There has not been a full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities, since 2015 and one is expected in 2020."

The Californian Democrat made the stunning claim during an interview with Axios that aired Sunday.
""I'm just hearing stuff that gins up a smaller and smaller base of people. And that's my point... California in the 1990s is a lot like America in 2019, 2020, 2021. And here's the real story -- The Republican party was walked off a cliff,"" Newsom said.
""They're third-party status. It's exactly what Donald Trump is doing and Mitch McConnell, who is completely complicit, is doing [to] the Republican party nationally. And they don't even know what's about to hit them.""
Newsom was asked about his perceived disconnection with middle America and Trump voters at large and said he grew up in a red, rural district which helps him understand the heartland.
""I spent 50 years of my life in rural California in one of the reddest parts of the state, in Placer County. We grew up with these folks, have deep respect for people in rural community [sic]. Deep,"" he said.
""I just don't want them to be lied to. I actually care about them. I'm not using them as a pawn. They're not being respected. They're being lied to. They're not connected to any movement. This guy -- you think Trump cares about them? He's a sole practitioner. You think they're being protected?""
Newsom said he has empathy for the GOP because they don't realize how far they're going to fall, as a result of their own actions.
""I honestly am empathetic towards what they are about to experience, which is a profound demise because of their own making,"" he said.

""They brought in this perfect young man who had no vital signs,"" said Dr. Angel Chudler, an emergency room physician at Beaumont Hospital, according to the hospital's blog. ""I said to my team, 'We're bringing him back.' And then I said to him, 'You better come back!'""
And after another jolt from the defibrillator, 20-year-old Michael Truitt came back.
""When he became conscious again, he was like the Hulk, grabbing the railings and shaking the bed with huge strength. It took the entire care team to hold Michael,"" Yasmeen Bachir, a clinical nurse who helped care for Truitt, said in the blog post, which also stated that Truitt was ""dead for 20 minutes"" prior to resuscitation.
Truitt had been working with his stepdad at a home in Livonia when a metal ladder he was carrying touched a live electrical wire. He said he doesn't remember anything past that, but the homeowner called 911 and started CPR. It took about four minutes for paramedics to arrive and they attempted to revive him with the defibrillator while en route to the hospital, but he never regained a heartbeat in the ambulance.
""In less than five minutes, brain cells start to die from lack of oxygen,"" Barbara Smith, the director of trauma services at Beaumont, told the hospital blog. ""Michael's resuscitation is miraculous. He did not lose any brain function. It's a testament to the importance of immediate continuous CPR to move oxygenated blood to the brain.""
The only lasting injury Pruitt has from the ordeal is in his toes, where the voltage electricity exited through his body, the website said."

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

On Monday, Fox News' Geraldo Rivera and Juan Williams discussed Buttigieg's handling of the town hall and his cities unhappiness regarding race relations and the police department.
""The black one-third of South Bend has apparently turned against the mayor. He's had an incredible run, Mayor Pete has, but I think that the rubber has met the road,"" Rivera said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum.""
A town hall Sunday became chaotic as the city struggled to respond to a deadly police-involved shooting last week that that highlighted a disconnect between African-American residents and Buttigieg.
Rivera suggested Buttigieg's candidacy is likely to end in South Carolina after the recent controversy.
""It seems to me that unless he can turn this around, his candidacy will hit South Carolina and end there, seems to me. He's not being accepted by the African-American community,"" Rivera said.
Williams agreed with Rivera's assessment, saying Buttigieg is looking like he's ""small town mayor"" -- not presidential.

 ""I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor. If he doesn't deal with this crises, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation,"" Williams said.
Williams also compared Buttigieg's controversy to former Vice President Joe Biden's recent blowback from saying that he was able to work with segregationists senators, saying it wasn't ""as serious as what Pete Buttigieg is going through.""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

The boisterous songstress opened up in a big way about her life as it is today and in true Halsey fashion, leaving no topic unexamined -- including her bipolar disorder, her ongoing battle to remain sober, and being a survivor of sexual assault. 
Simply put, Halsey has seen an eyeful in her two decades of life.
""I know I'm just going to get f---ing depressed and be boring again soon,"" the 24-year-old told Rolling Stone of her manic and often unpredictable diagnosis in an interview published Monday. ""And I hate that that's a way of thinking. Every time I wake up and realize I'm back in a depressive episode, I'm bummed.""
Halsey, whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, said she was diagnosed as bipolar at age 17 following a suicide attempt. However, she says she now embraces who she is and everything her diagnosis comes with -- even if her mental state makes her more explosive and prone to doing ""crazy s---.""
After ""getting cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times"" and splitting with rapper G-Eazy for good, Halsey has a much clearer conscience and has seemed to find her purpose. She managed to stay atop the charts for 12 consecutive weeks with ""Closer,"" her collaboration with the Chainsmokers -- and also landed her a first number one solo single with ""Without Me,"" an ode to her breakup with the Bay Area emcee. 
In the lengthy artist profile, the ""Ghost"" performer who has been an advocate for survivors of sexual abuse said she recently confronted her abuser. The multiplatinum artist said the person who allegedly abused her ""took it seriously, went to rehab, sought therapy."" 
While she is glad she is now able to speak out about her difficult past, Halsey refuses to be categorized as a victim. ""I have worked way too f---ing hard to be quantified or categorized by something like that,"" she said.  ""Then I'm not 'Grammy-nominated pop star,' then I'm 'rape survivor,'"" she said with a tremor. 
""Uh-uh, no. Absolutely not,"" she added.
Halsey admitted that she had been in a dark place during her journey and said she has made massive changes in her life to correct the negative imbalances she carried. This started with letting go of the drugs and adjusting her drinking habits.
""I support my whole family,"" she said. ""I have multiple houses, I pay taxes, I run a business. I just can't be out getting f--- up all the time.""

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.
""There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions."""

In most contests, the team having more fun, wins.
And the team that loses its sense of humor, loses - period.
Take Friday, when President Trump posted a meme predicting he'll be president for ever. And ever.
Normal people, i.e. people not in the media, and therefore not under the spell of irrational obsessions, saw this as light-hearted trolling, mocking the Triggered Trump Critics like this fella:
Bill Maher: ""If he loses, Trump, he won't go. I've been saying that since before he got elected.""
And he was a comedian - once.
It's so obvious it hurts. But still the media reports Trump's jokes as dire warnings.
Here's a Mediaite headline, screaming: ""Trump posts insane Twitter video threatening to be president for eternity.""
""Threatening.""
What moron writes this stuff? It's hard to say: they got a staff of them.
I'm anxiously awaiting their expose on why the chicken really crossed the road. Or does time really fly if you throw a clock through the air? I bet that gets three Pinocchios.
How did these people get so - to use the medical term - stupid?
Well, the media, once operating under the guise of journalism, are now just hall monitors and pundit-finks. Their job reduced to screaming ""look what someone said on TV! It's a joke - but not to us!""
They barely get out of bed anymore. Their workplace attire: sweatpants and an open bathrobe.
But that's today's media: reporting on you, as you make them the butt of the joke.  Like Chuck!
Chuck Todd: You've joked about a third term, you've joked about these things.
Trump: I only joke. I joke and say 'watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy.'

The printing is on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia through the end of 2019. This is also the first time that the print has been displayed in a museum.
Printed by newspaper publisher and printer John Holt in New York in 1776, the artifact is addressed to Col. David Mulford, a Revolutionary War colonel who died of smallpox in 1778. The print stayed in the possession of Mulford's family until 2017, when it was sold to Holly Metcalf Kinyon, herself a descendant of Declaration signer John Witherspoon.
""The Mulford family's deep appreciation for history enabled me to connect with my American heritage in a profound way,"" said Kinyon in a statement. ""Women played a vital role in preserving this printing of the Declaration and it's my privilege to see it displayed publicly again by the Museum of the American Revolution.""
""We are honored to be able to share this extraordinary treasure of the American founding with our visitors this summer,"" said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, President and CEO of the Museum of the American Revolution. ""It is humbling to stand in the presence of such an authentic witness to our nation's birth.""
Revolutionary War artifacts offer a fascinating glimpse into the events that shaped America. Items in the Museum of the American Revolution's collection include George Washington's tent and his headquarters flag.
In December 2018, the remains of the famous Revolutionary War frigate USS Bonhomme Richard were discovered off the coast of the U.K., more than 200 years after it sank following a naval battle.
Earlier this year, a rare powder horn that belonged to an African American soldier killed in the Revolutionary War went on display at the Museum of the American Revolution.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.
""Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,"" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family."

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times.""

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

Natasha, 15, suffered a severe allergic reaction after eating sesame in an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought in Heathrow Airport.
She died of anaphylaxis after collapsing on board a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016.
The coroner looking into her death said Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging.
Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"" and said it would be listing all ingredients on its freshly made food.
A spokesman said: ""Full ingredient labels are now in over 60 Pret shops as part of our nationwide rollout. 
""Before we took this step, we ran a number of pilots to confirm that this approach would be safe, practical and effective.
""We are pleased that the Government has chosen to support full ingredient labelling."""

Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.
The swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.
Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.
He and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: ""My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer."" He responds: ""Yeah. That's me.""
Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.
Christensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.
There are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.
Zhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.

Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.
The swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.
Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.

The International Olympic Committee on Monday voted to hold the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.
Italy won the bid over Stockholm-Are, of Sweden, to host the Winter Games. It'll be the first time the Games will be held in Italy since Turin hosted in 2006.
Cortina d'Ampezzo, a ski town in northern Italy, hosted the Olympics in 1956. Sweden has never hosted the Winter Games, but Stockholm was the host of the 1912 Summer Games.
Both Italy and Sweden's bids made their final pitches to the IOC on Monday during a nine-hour meeting to choose a winner.
In their final presentations to win the bid from the IOC, the prime ministers of Italy and Sweden both pushed for their nations to host the 2026 games.
Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, noted that support in Italy is strong for an Olympic Games, and was a focal point of their bid. His presentation highlighted how 83 percent of the Italian population is in favor of the games, with 87 percent rising in Milan.
He said: ""If I am here today in front of you, it is thanks to the enthusiasm of all Italy. ... This is the dream of an entire country, and not only the government but also the regions.""
Sweden Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""it's in our DNA"" to deliver a stable Winter Games after the IOC's own polling determined there was around 60 percent public backing in Sweden to host the games. The bid was challenged to prove its support from a Stockholm city authority coalition formed last October and a national government only five months ago.
The mayor of Stockholm, Anna Konig Jerlmyr, played up ABBA -- Sweden's most famous musical act -- telling the committee: ""ABBA is everywhere."" She then broke out into her own rendition of ""Dancing Queen.""

For better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.
Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2."

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.

He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said."

In an Instagram post early Monday, Jackson reposted a photo of two side-by-side posters promoting his upcoming film ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" which depicted his character, Nick Fury, with his signature eye patch placed on two different eyes, rather than only the correct left eye.
""Uhhhhhhh, What In The Actual F-- IS GOING ON HERE???!!!,"" the actor captioned the picture, adding the hashtags, ""#headsgonroll #lefteyemuthafu--ah.""
The original photo was initially posted by an observant Marvel fan on Reddit, with the humorous title, ""Which eye did he injure?""
One Reddit user jokingly claimed, ""All this time Nick Fury has just been defrauding the government for disability.""
Another user quipped, ""Obviously, one of the pictures is actually a selfie which is why it's flipped compared to the other.""
Jackson's character of Nick Fury has remained a staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ever since his debut in the first ""Iron Man"" film in 2008. The origin of Fury's iconic eyepatch was revealed during a scene in the recent ""Captain Marvel,"" when Fury's eye was scratched by the film's fan-favorite cat, Goose.
""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" hits theaters July 2 and stars Jackson with main actor Tom Holland as Spider-Man, as well as Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal.

""2020 Democrats are ramping up their radicalism. They want to be the most radical. Let me be clear, what we're witnessing from this new extreme socialist Democratic Party, this is beyond socialism even, it is unhinged,"" Hannity said on his television show Monday. ""It is beyond impractical. It is divisive and destructive to the country.""
Hannity played a multitude of clips highlighting what he felt were the more extreme elements the Democratic presidential candidates were promising and he went after South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg who has been criticized over his handling of a police officer shooting a African-American man, highlighting racial tensions in the city.
""Buttigieg has been a total absentee mayor and a failure,"" Hannity said. ""He's hardly ever in South Bend.""
Hannity  warned his viewers the that Democrats have moved even further left and want to take the country in a direction beyond even what the Obama administration had wanted to.
""Instead of sticking to any principles real agenda real policy that will help the forgotten men and women that got destroyed under the Biden-Obama economy, the extreme left now has gone further out to the fringe pandering to every corner of the Democratic Party,"" Hannity said.
The host blasted candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for supporting reparations for gay Americans and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for saying he would meet with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
""Of course specifics aren't a priority for the new radical Democrats and they're not going to tell us how to pay for anything they'll say and do anything to try and get elected, to take away every person's fear with false promises and lies that really are about their power,"" Hannity said,"

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.

The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love."""

Barry Postman, Woods' attorney, said in a statement obtained by Fox News that the decision by Nicholas Immesberger's parents to drop Woods from the suit was ""clearly appropriate.""
""While the situation was tragic, the facts will ultimately show that the cause of Mr. Immesberger's car accident were the many decisions made by Mr. Immesberger on the night of his passing,"" the statement read.
The lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County last month alleged that before the crash, Immesberger, a bartender at The Woods in Jupiter, Fla., was over-served for about three hours after his shift at the restaurant was over.
Woods is an investor in the restaurant. His girlfriend, Erica Herman, the general manager, is still named in the suit, along with the restaurant, The Washington Post reported.
The amdended suit claims that Herman recruited Immesberger as a bartender there despite knowing he was an alcoholic. It alleges restaurant employees, managers and owners let Immesberger drive after being over-served alcohol.
The initial lawsuit claimed, ""Tiger knew, or reasonably should have known, that Immesberger was habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages, and/or was a habitual drunkard.""
The amended lawsuit--filed last week by the parents--no longer names Woods.

In most contests, the team having more fun, wins.
And the team that loses its sense of humor, loses - period.
Take Friday, when President Trump posted a meme predicting he'll be president for ever. And ever.
Normal people, i.e. people not in the media, and therefore not under the spell of irrational obsessions, saw this as light-hearted trolling, mocking the Triggered Trump Critics like this fella:
Bill Maher: ""If he loses, Trump, he won't go. I've been saying that since before he got elected.""
And he was a comedian - once.
It's so obvious it hurts. But still the media reports Trump's jokes as dire warnings.
Here's a Mediaite headline, screaming: ""Trump posts insane Twitter video threatening to be president for eternity.""
""Threatening.""
What moron writes this stuff? It's hard to say: they got a staff of them.
I'm anxiously awaiting their expose on why the chicken really crossed the road. Or does time really fly if you throw a clock through the air? I bet that gets three Pinocchios.
How did these people get so - to use the medical term - stupid?
Well, the media, once operating under the guise of journalism, are now just hall monitors and pundit-finks. Their job reduced to screaming ""look what someone said on TV! It's a joke - but not to us!""
They barely get out of bed anymore. Their workplace attire: sweatpants and an open bathrobe.
But that's today's media: reporting on you, as you make them the butt of the joke.  Like Chuck!
Chuck Todd: You've joked about a third term, you've joked about these things.
Trump: I only joke. I joke and say 'watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy.'
Chuck Todd: You will accept the result. And you will accept - whatever happens in 2020.
Trump: Sure.
Chuck Todd: You lose, you're gonna be - you're not gonna like it, but you'll walk out.
Trump: Sure. In fact, I said in a speech recently, I said 'watch, we'll drive the media crazy - let's go for a third term, and then a fourth,' and some of the media said 'he's going to do it!'
What a treat - the trolls reporting on how they got trolled. It's too easy, and almost unfair.
To think we're gonna have at least two, three, or four terms of this.

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times.""

Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.

Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said.

Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.

Mutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Monday on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.
More than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.
Rebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.
Mutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.
""Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,"" he said.
""How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,"" he said. ""I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.""
The idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.
""We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,"" Redfield said.
Mutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""

The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""

In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack."""

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""
""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

However, the former foreign secretary and London mayor has spoken to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, defending his Brexit plans and decision not to speak about the widely reported row between himself and his partner Carrie Symonds.
He said he did not believe ""for a moment"" that the UK would leave the EU without a deal, although he was willing for it to happen if necessary. Mr Johnson also said the EU would have to co-operate to avoid a hard Irish border.
On his personal life, he refused to describe what had happened with Ms Symonds in the early hours of last Friday, saying: ""I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones.""

The government is to introduce a law forcing businesses to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food. This follows the death in 2016 of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse after an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette. Her parents, Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who have campaigned for changes to the law, said they were ""delighted"". ""Natasha's Law"" is set to come into force in England and Northern Ireland by summer 2021.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.
