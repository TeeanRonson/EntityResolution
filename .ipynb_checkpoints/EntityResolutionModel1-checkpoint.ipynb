    "\n",
    "Dedupe is a library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe will help us remove duplicate entries from our people dataset of name entities, whilst taking into account the paragraph information which provides context to the named entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Types\n",
    "A variable definition describes the records that you want to match. It is a dictionary where the keys are the fields and the values are the field specification. For our example, we will use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String Types\n",
    "String types are compared using affine gap string distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Types\n",
    "Fields containing long blocks of text e.g. product descriptions or article abstracts we use the Text type fields. These are compared using the cosine similarity metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a measurement of the amount of words that two documents have in common. This measure can be made more useful as the overlap of rare words counts more than the overlap of common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If provided a sequence of example fields (i.e. a corpus) then dedupe will learn these weights for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name Types\n",
    "A Name variable should be used for a field that contains American names, corporations and households. It uses the probablepeople package to split apart a name string into components like give name, surname, generational suffix, for people names, and abbreviation, company type, and legal form for corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose column types --> Train Model --> Review Clusters --> Add to clusters --> Polish Clusters"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Record similarity\n",
    "We make the assumpiton that records that are more similar are more likely to be duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default way that this is done in Dedupe is to use what’s called a string metric. A string metric is a way of taking two strings and returning a number that is low if the strings are similar and high if they are dissimilar. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different string metrics, and we actually use a metric called the Affine Gap Distance. It counts the number of substitutions that must be made to turn one string into another. It is similar to our familiar Levenshtein distance, that is used in Fuzzy Wuzzy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularized logistic regression\n",
    "If we supply pairs of records that we label as either being duplicates or distinct, then Dedupe will learn a set of weights such that the record distance can easily be transformed into our best estimate of the probability that a pair of records are duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have learned these good weights, we want to use them to find which records are duplicates. But turns out that doing this the naive way will usually not work, and we’ll have to do something smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active Learning\n",
    "In order to learn those weights, Dedupe needs example pairs with labels. Most of the time, we will need to supply those labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the whole point of Dedupe is to save people’s time, and that includes making good use of your labeling time so we use an approach called Active Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we maintain a set of the pairs where there is disagreement: that is pairs which classifier believes are duplicates but which are not covered by the current blocking rules, and the pairs which the classifier believes are distinct but which are blocked together.\n",
    "\n",

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream.

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.)

The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n\n",

But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home.

The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n\n",

To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls.

Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream.

I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.\"\\nThe \"Hardball\" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died \"weren't the bad guys.\"\\n\"The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,\" Matthews elaborated.\\n\"We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.\"\\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.</td>\n",

I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.\"\\nThe \"Hardball\" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died \"weren't the bad guys.\"\\n\"The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,\" Matthews elaborated.\\n\"We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.\"\\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.
