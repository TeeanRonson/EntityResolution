27303955,331842,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Bard College,ORGANIZATION,92610,20,3,"How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,"" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.
""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'"" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.
As embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.
Doing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.
He's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.
Making his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is ""Oklahoma!"" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.
Such a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.
Mr. Fish's version isn't the first ""Oklahoma!"" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.
But this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips ""Oklahoma!"" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's ""Green Grow the Lilacs"") takes place.
Laura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)
There's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.
The cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.
Though the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).
Oh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.
These people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in ""Oklahoma!"" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.
Ms. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.
But there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.
That her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings ""Pore Jud,"" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.
The scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.
I first saw Mr. Fish's ""Oklahoma!"" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.
At the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.
The other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads ""Dream Baby Dream.""
What she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.
As she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.
She's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.

15304668,305370,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,American Legion,ORGANIZATION,56097,8,3,"As you enter the theater, there are 163 men onstage.
Not in person, but in battalions of framed photographs staring down from the walls of an American Legion hall circa 1987.
Soon a 15-year-old girl named Heidi arrives, with a compulsively ingratiating smile and a buttercup yellow blazer. She is there, in essence, to debate them.
Hardly seems like a fair fight, does it? It's not meant to be. Heidi Schreck's ""What the Constitution Means to Me,"" which opened on Broadway at the Helen Hayes Theater on Sunday, is nothing less than a chronicle of the legal subjugation of women by men, as experienced in the day-to-day injustices of living while female and in the foundational American document that offers paltry recourse.
But if ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" is nothing less than that, it is also very much more. It is a tragedy told as a comedy, a work of inspired protest, a slyly crafted piece of persuasion and a tangible contribution to the change it seeks. It is not just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important.
Unlike typical ""important"" plays, it doesn't announce itself as such. Rachel Hauck's diorama set, already minimal during an Off Broadway run at New York Theater Workshop last year, is a bit smaller at the Hayes. (There were 205 men Off Broadway.) The cast remains tiny. Oliver Butler's rivetingly intelligent production includes no special effects except the kind achieved by words.
But watch out: In a play that parses the meaning of a 230-year-old legal document, words are tricky.
""What the Constitution Means to Me"" even begins in deception. Addressing the audience directly, Ms. Schreck, now 47, tells and sometimes enacts the impossibly sunny story of how, as a teenager, she earned the money that would put her through college by  preaching about the Constitution at competitions around the country. In these competitions, sponsored by the American Legion, she and other entrants were asked to give seven-minute orations that drew a ""personal connection between your own life and the document"" before extemporizing on an amendment selected onstage at random.
Young Heidi's stock speech compared the Constitution, hilariously, to a witch's caldron. (Her chief competitor went with a patchwork quilt metaphor.) But unpacking the Ninth Amendment in her oration, and responding to the 14th in her extemporaneous challenge, Heidi often avoided making those valuable personal connections.
We feel the suppression. From the start, something violent and presumptively male has been threatening the complacent skin of the story. (A legionnaire played by Mike Iveson sits at the sidelines, occasionally explaining the rules but mostly just watching.) Ms. Schreck's jokes, left unrefrigerated a second too long, keep curdling after the laugh. She zooms past certain details -- such as growing up in an ""abortion-free zone"" -- as if they were haunted houses.
They are. And in the next part of the play, removing her jacket and reintroducing herself as a grown woman less eager to please, she lets the ghosts out. We learn about her great-great-grandmother, a melancholic mail-order bride; the history of domestic abuse in her family; and her brush with certain rights the Supreme Court eventually located in the ""penumbra"" of the Ninth Amendment and in the right to privacy of the 14th.
But seen now from the other side of the great achievements of the civil rights, women's rights and gay rights movements -- all of which are threatened by the same shadowy vagueness that nurtured them in the first place -- the penumbra is not a field of freedoms but a wasteland of neglect. If you are not a white, male landowner as envisioned by the founding fathers, the Constitution has little to offer you.
""Our bodies had been left out of the document from the beginning,"" Ms. Schreck says.
Statements like that, out of context, may make ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" seem merely polemical, possibly misandrist and surely grim. It's none of those things. Though it is angrier and more pointed now than it was downtown, its wording clearer and its jokes finer tuned, it is also more accessible. Ms. Schreck, known as an actor before she was known as a playwright, gives a real and wrenching performance, not a speech. And Mr. Butler has shaped the play's representation of maleness -- largely through Ms. Schreck's interactions with the inventive Mr. Iveson -- with loving complexity.
Least of all is the play grim. Although it takes us through the classic sequence of tragedy, from hubris to recognition to horror, it doesn't bring down the curtain there. After forcing you to consider for 80 minutes whether your civics class enthusiasm for the Constitution is still defensible, Ms. Schreck then introduces a 20-minute coda that includes a live debate on the subject. (Topic: Should We Abolish the U.S. Constitution?) After a coin toss, a guest debater from a local high school takes one side and Ms. Schreck the other. An audience member judges.
At the performance I saw, Rosdely Ciprian, a preternaturally composed 14-year-old New Yorker, spoke for abolishment. (At alternate performances, the guest debater is Thursday Williams.) Ms. Ciprian's arguments, honed during a year of the play's development, are sophisticated and cutting, and often hilarious. But so are Ms. Schreck's. Of course, at other performances, they might wind up arguing the opposite positions.
That they are debating at all is an antidote to grimness. It's also an instance of theatrical activism at its purest, modeling the world the play hopes to achieve: one in which even first principles are open to vigorous, orderly debate, and in which all stakeholders, not just powerful ones, are invited to the podium.
After all, Ms. Schreck points out, it would have been impossible for two women to argue policy on a public stage when the Constitution was written. They couldn't have voted until 1920. Even then, the barriers faced by Ms. Ciprian, who is Dominican-American, and Ms. Williams, who is Jamaican-American, might well have been insuperable.
Being underage, they can't vote now, either; some of the unexpected joy of ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" comes from the hope that people so smart and passionate and ready for change will soon be part of the electorate.
Joy comes too from watching an imaginative new kind of theater emerge. It doesn't come from nowhere, of course: In some ways, ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" recalls Lisa Kron's memoir play ""Well,"" in which a prepared speech about urban decline is hijacked by a mother who begs to differ. In other ways, Ms. Schreck's play seems to be part of the wave of formal experimentation being led by young black playwrights today.
Linking these works is a sense of backlash and betrayal. But in the wake of tragedy, Ms. Schreck offers something more than catharsis. ""What the Constitution Means to Me"" is one of the things we always say we want theater to be: an act of civic engagement. It restarts an argument many of us forgot we even needed to have.

45289207,424080,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,New Orleans Pelicans,ORGANIZATION,6533,1,1,"Everyone knew weeks ago that the New Orleans Pelicans would claim Duke star Zion Williamson with the first pick in the NBA Draft.
If only we could enjoy such lucidity on Capitol Hill.
White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.
Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.
Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.

""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.
Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.

""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.
Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.

Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate.

Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government.

Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate.

Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.
""We're close,"" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: ""I think we're further apart.""
The varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.
Just before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.
""We're going to get it done,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. ""We have to.""
The big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.
""You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Congressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.
""Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,"" McConnell said last month.
Then came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.
Everything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a ""cover-up"" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.
Granted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing ""Kumbaya"" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.
So, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.
""In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,"" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. ""Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.""
Standing next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.
Pelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.
""When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,"" Pelosi said.
The Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.
""Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?"" retorted an agitated Pelosi. ""Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.""
That conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government.

Mulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.
""I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
One senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney ""p---ed everybody off"" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.
However, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.
After the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.
""Everybody is trying to raise the caps,"" said Mulvaney.
After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.
""So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,"" said Mulvaney.
The Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House ""deemed"" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.
Hoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: ""Overseas Contingency Operations"" or ""OCO."" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.
""That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,"" said Hoyer. ""[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.""
The lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.
When asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied ""as long as we can get. As early as we can get.""
But the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as ""messaging"" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.
One source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.
Republicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.
The downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.
So this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.

22317045,283956,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,NPR,ORGANIZATION,2991,7,1,"Some plays are seeds and some are stones.
Seeds are the ones that grow and change over the course of their stage time -- and maybe, in the minds of those who see them, forever.
Stones are the ones that always remain exactly what they are. They never expand but can still knock you out.
""Accidentally Brave,"" which opened on Monday, is a stone. Not just for us but also for its author, Maddie Corman, giving a riveting performance, mostly as herself. The real-life situation she has endured over the past four years, and replays eight times a week at the DR2 Theater, still hangs on her heart. It may always.
The ""thing"" began, as far as Ms. Corman knew, in the summer of 2015. Driving to a television soundstage in Brooklyn at 5 a.m. to tape an episode of ""a semi-terrible TV show,"" she received a frantic call from her home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. While in the background her 11-year-old twin boys cry, her 16-year-old daughter shrieks in terror. Police are there and are ""taking Dad's computer.""
Dad was, and is, Jace Alexander, a director known for his work on ""Law & Order."" As BuzzFeed reported, investigators who entered the couple's house that day recovered files from Mr. Alexander's devices ""that showed minors engaged in sexual acts.""
What happens when your husband of 17 years, your ""best person,"" your ""friend and confidant and true-blue love"" -- not to mention your children's father, who sings songs at the piano and listens to NPR -- turns out to be a compulsive consumer of child pornography?
""Accidentally Brave"" recounts Ms. Corman's shame and confusion as every prop beneath her warm, stable, suburban life gets knocked out. Nor does the emotional chaos end after Mr. Alexander completes a 45-day rehab for sex addiction and is sentenced, in 2016, to 10 years' probation. Though he was never accused of touching any child inappropriately, he must also register as a sex offender.
As the family transfers the twins to a new school, then relocates to a new neighborhood, all the while forced to forgo ordinary pleasures like coaching youth soccer and inviting children to trick-or-treat at their house, Ms. Corman tries to understand how the disaster happened and how she can survive it.
""Accidentally Brave"" does not offer answers. For one thing, Ms. Corman provides few details about Mr. Alexander. What happened to him is ""not my story to tell,"" she says. And though she breaks her rule just enough to suggest the existence of explanatory events that ""happened"" in his youth, she does not in any way attempt to inhabit him the way she inhabits herself, her children and her friends, both stalwart and fair-weather. She never even mentions his name.
Given her skill at investing stage characters with palpable humanity -- her daughter's scream is both bloodcurdling and heartbreaking -- this denial feels like an especially powerful expression of anger. And yet the real twist in the tale (though it's not a spoiler) is that she and Mr. Alexander remain married, and have in some ways improved their relationship through the restart forced upon them.
That's a development that might have been easier to understand had it been dramatized, in scenes that did not quarantine important parts of the story and that inched toward resolution in real time. I wanted to see, rather than just hear as an anecdote, how Ms. Corman came to understand her husband as someone who isn't evil but unwell, poisoned by pornography. And how she came to stand by him, as her wedding vows promised, in sickness, not just in health.
Ms. Corman, a professional actor since her teens -- and herself the victim of sexual harassment at a young age -- could certainly have performed such a script. With her nanosecond timing, she has nailed tricky ensemble scenes as both a sophisticated sidekick (in ""Next Fall"") and an artless matron (in ""The Babylon Line""), among many others.
Here, though, the form forces her to create an illusion of drama through a kind of solo montage. Several customized bravura sequences show her toggling with daredevil facility among various characters and moods. She smash-cuts from devastation to furor to false calm as if road testing them to see which is most useful.
Though you can't help responding to the intensity of these acting moments, there is something slick about ""Accidentally Brave"" that comes with the confessional monologue genre. Ms. Corman may hate the word ""journeys"" but her script is not free of self-help jargon. More than once she offers the de rigueur (yet unnecessary) excuse that in telling her story she hopes ""to be of service.""
The production, directed by Kristin Hanggi, seems to take its cue from the same idea, couching despair in a pastel atmosphere of hope. The projections (by Elaine J. McCarthy) and original music (by Claire Wellin) suggest a special episode of ""Oprah."" There is even an Oprah-like character -- a ""very amazing and very famous"" person identified only as Angel -- who blows into the story from time to time to offer support and advice.
I don't know how many people have connections to Angels. Nor do I know how many could afford the deluxe Arizona rehab that helped Ms. Corman's husband. ""Accidentally Brave"" nevertheless contends at every turn that families can survive psychological devastation and reformulate themselves on a more solid if somber basis.
It's nice to think so -- and for people enduring such trauma, that's undoubtedly, yes, a service.
But the monologue form being what it is, Ms. Corman's performance is more convincing with the negatives than with the positives. Is that because -- even absent disaster -- life is, too?
""Accidentally Brave"" can't help you there.

31202469,320418,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,British Parliament,ORGANIZATION,70687,7,1,"That was the way I felt during much of Sam Gold's production of ""King Lear,"" which opened on Thursday night with the extraordinary Glenda Jackson in the title role. It should surprise no one that Ms. Jackson is delivering a powerful and deeply perceptive performance as the most royally demented of Shakespeare's monarchs.
But much of what surrounds her in this glittery, haphazard production seems to be working overtime to divert attention from that performance. That includes a perfectly lovely string quartet -- playing original music by Philip Glass, no less -- that under other circumstances I would have enjoyed listening to.
Here, though, this intermittent concert seems to be competing with, rather than underscoring, Shakespeare's bleakest tragedy. The same might be said of Miriam Buether's blindingly gold set (lighted to sear the eyes by Jane Cox), which blazes with nouveau riche vulgarity.
Perhaps we are meant to think of the gilded surfaces of Trump pleasure domes, though I'm not sure that's the intention. To be honest, I'm not sure of a lot of the intentions behind the choices here.
That includes those of many of the supporting players, who include the formidable likes of Ruth Wilson, Elizabeth Marvel, Jayne Houdyshell and John Douglas Thompson. By and large, the performances seem to have been blown into uneasy coexistence by random winds from different directions.
Yet there, amid the chaos, is Ms. Jackson, like a sharp and gleaming scythe slashing through an overgrown field. Lear may be one of world literature's most disturbingly lost souls. But Ms. Jackson hews to his tortured path with such insight that we register every twisting contour in a dispossessed monarch's road into madness and redemption. That is, when the view of him isn't obstructed by the garish obstacle course that has been assembled for him to run.
This is the role with which Ms. Jackson, a two-time Oscar winner, returned to the stage to hosannas -- at London's Old Vic in 2016 -- after 23 years as a member of the British Parliament. Continuing what is sure to remain one of the most remarkable second -- or is it third? -- acts in show business, Ms. Jackson proceeded to Broadway in 2018 to appear not as Lear, but as the aged, bitter, death-denying central figure of Edward Albee's ""Three Tall Women.""
She deservedly won the 2018 Tony Award for best actress for that performance. Now, at last, New York has the chance to see her Lear, albeit in a different production, and it is a carefully faceted jewel.
The surprise here isn't that a woman is playing a man, which quickly comes to seem irrelevant. What's more unexpected is the subtlety with which this natural powerhouse shades her character from the start.
Unlike most Lears, Ms. Jackson doesn't begin in full, imperious spleen. When we first meet him, he's a tyrant who doesn't have to raise his voice because he assumes his every wish is everybody else's command. Unquestioning obedience from those who orbit him is the central fact of his life.
When he exiles his youngest, best-loved daughter, Cordelia (a sullen Ms. Wilson) because she isn't sufficiently effusive in her praise of him, it feels like a petulant, conditioned reflex, the caprice of a moment that he might later reverse.
Except, of course, he's renounced his power, dividing his kingdom among his sycophantic older daughters, Goneril and Regan (Elizabeth Marvel and Aisling O'Sullivan, whose accents suggest they grew up in very different parts of the world).
From that moment, Lear's will is no longer the world's law, a change of circumstance that dumbfounds him. Ms. Jackson turns his fall from power into a carefully graded ascent into self-knowledge. Yes, this king howls and rants and reviles, after being turned out by the daughters he assumed would always worship him.
But his madness is that of a cosseted egotist who has experienced an electric shock to his solipsism. Divested of home and ""the large effects that troop with majesty,"" Lear is forced to perceive the loneliness and nakedness of the human lot, and Ms. Jackson makes sure that we see him seeing it.
On that blasted heath, in the fabled storm of the third act (bizarrely played on the shallow ledge left by the fallen drop curtain), what registers most poignantly aren't the violent imprecations.
It's Lear's astonished, self-lacerating recognition of what he calls ""unaccommodated man"" as a universal condition. When Lear startlingly sees himself in a half-naked beggar (Sean Carvajal as the disguised Edgar) on the heath, Ms. Jackson's wondering, wounded expression suggests an epiphany that's both glorious and damning.
Sad to say, nothing else in this production matches her incisiveness.
Mr. Gold took brazen but rewarding liberties with Shakespeare in his excellent, starry New York productions of ""Othello"" (with Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo, in 2016) and ""Hamlet"" (with Oscar Isaac in 2017).
Presented in intimate Off Broadway houses, these shows made the audience feel complicit with performers, who seemed to be excavating their characters and unearthing precious discoveries as we watched. Mr. Gold's ""Lear"" is filled with gimmicky stage business that hasn't been refined into a more fully integrated point of view.
Or maybe the problem is that the cast members seem to be moving to different internal music and rhythms, so that no one appears to be in sync with anyone else. Is that Mr. Gold's point? It seems fitting that in this version, Regan's husband, the Duke of Cornwall (Russell Harvard), is deaf. Is Cornwall's aide (Michael Arden) -- who conspicuously interprets speeches into vigorous sign language -- perhaps meant to signify the difficulty of disparate souls communicating?
Oh, I don't know. Nor did I really understand why there was a life-size ceramic pug and lion by Lear's throne. Or why everyone -- including Lear's supposedly ill-kempt, rowdy soldiers -- looks like extras from ""Downton Abbey"" in their evening clothes (the illustrious Ann Roth did the costumes), forever sipping tea or Champagne, even when the world is falling apart.
(I think I do understand why Ms. Wilson's piquant, Cockney-accented Fool, after delivering a poem about the topsy-turviness of an unhinged world, pulls up his trousers to reveal American flag socks. But it's a desperate and sour bid for relevance.)
The cast members at least seem to know what they're saying, although few of them (the double-cast Ms. Wilson is an exception) have taken the next step in creating complete portraits. Mr. Thompson (as the faithful Kent) and Ms. Houdyshell (as the doomed, fatuous Gloucester) and Pedro Pascal (as the dastardly Edmund) deliver clear-spoken but oddly unmodulated performances.
Ms. Marvel at least seems to have a thought-through idea for her Goneril (as a sexually overcharged society hostess). But it's hard to imagine her emerging from the same royal nursery as Ms. O'Sullivan's shrill, primal Regan.
Such disparities mean that the kingdom of Lear becomes a very, very lonely planet, where no one has anyone to talk to, really. Maybe that's why so many of the performers pitch their monologues directly to the audience, like stand-up comics in search of reassurance.
That does not include Ms. Jackson's Lear. Her monologues are delivered defiantly to the heavens, as if she had a direct line to a cruel and almighty God. On the basis of this supremely intelligent performance, I don't doubt that she does.

45388070,424547,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Catholic News Agency,ORGANIZATION,8039,6,1,"A British court on Monday overruled a lower court's ruling that would have forced a mentally disabled woman to undergo an abortion 22 weeks into her pregnancy.
The reversal came after the mother of the woman, who's a former midwife, appealed the initial court ruling last Friday in which the judge said abortion was ""in the best interests"" of the pregnant woman.
The appeal court judges Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Jackson said they will disclose the reasons for overturning the decision at a later time, the Guardian reported.
The case of an unnamed woman, a Roman Catholic with developmental disabilities and the mental age of a 6- to 9-year-old, has galvanized the pro-life community in Britain and around the globe.
Over 116,000 people signed a pro-life petition posted on Saturday that asked the U.S. government to intervene in the case ""to prevent this gross injustice being inflicted by the State on this family and ensure this woman is not forced to have an abortion.""
Scottish Bishop John Keenan of the Diocese of Paisley shared the petition and warned that the ruling otherwise ""introduces a dangerous new development in the overreach of the power of the state over its citizens,"" the Catholic News Agency reported.
Bishop John Sherrington, an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Westminster, said the initial ruling not only ""infringes upon her human rights"" but also ""the right of her unborn child to life in a family that has committed to caring for the child.""
Justice Nathalie Lieven admitted in the initial ruling that it's an ""immense intrusion"" to order the abortion against the woman's will, but argued that it's in the best interest of the woman.
""I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" the justice said. ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""
Both the pregnant woman, her mother, and a social worker who's looking after the woman argued in court that the pregnancy shouldn't be terminated.
But the judge said the woman didn't have the mental capacity to make her own decisions even it look like she wanted to continue the pregnancy.
""I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,"" she said, pointing out that she didn't fully comprehend what having a baby entails.

45345091,424388,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Navy,ORGANIZATION,5817,1,1,"SAN DIEGO- An expert witness called by the prosecution in the court-martial trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher told the court Monday that there is no physical or photographic evidence to prove a stabbing occurred in the death of an ISIS prisoner back in 2017. 
Dr. Frank Sheridan, a forensic pathologist, told a Navy prosecutor earlier that the alleged victim's injuries were consistent with a stab wound, but later-- when questioned by Gallagher's attorney-- appeared to cast doubt on his earlier comments.
""There is no evidence at all that a stabbing occurred,"" said Maj. Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. 
""That's true,"" Sheridan replied.
""As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?"" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. ""As far as I can see,"" the pathologist said.
""Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,"" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.
Gallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. 
Its most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his ""thumb over his TT tube"" until the ISIS teen ""quit breathing."" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.
Gallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.
Investigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.
Those allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.
In a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for ""dragging"" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.
""They were taken out of the house in their underwear,"" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. ""Yes, sir,"" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited ""standard protocol,"" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.
The trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.
""This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,"" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. ""He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.""

45389092,424548,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Soho Farmhouse,ORGANIZATION,348204,6,2,"Harry and Meghan's refurb of their Frogmore Cottage home has so far cost taxpayers a whopping $3 million in U.S. dollars. The couple's new residence now boasts a designer kitchen -- part of a taxpayer- funded refurb which will cost nearly $3.8 million when all the costs are added.
Royal accounts show work on the couple's home has so far cost the public far more than original estimates, sparking fury from campaigners. Their five-bedroom property -- a gift from the Queen -- is said to have required a ""substantial overhaul"" before they were able to move in, including new heating, wiring and utilities.
But the public also coughed up for the kitchen, bathrooms and even fitted wardrobes and storage, as well as a renowned interior designer. However, officials said the couple did pay for their own ""fixtures and fittings"". The books for all the royals show the monarchy cost the taxpayer almost $105 million last year.
Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, moved into their new home in April, a month before baby Archie Harrison was born. When the Sun last year revealed their planned relocation, officials tried to downplay the cost, saying it would be closer to $1.9 million. But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost $3 million in the financial year to April alone.
Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted -- so the true cost is expected to be closer to $3.8 million. The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home. A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.
Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members' club popular with celebs.
Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up. He said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.""
He added: ""The building was returned to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. ""Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.""
A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.
The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds. Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is ""part of a five-year repainting and repair program."" They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extra if they wanted a more bespoke version.
Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household's official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer $105 million in 2018/19, or $1.58 per person in the UK. It spent $85 million of that -- a year-on-year rise of almost $25 million -- thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.
The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a ""blatant misuse of public money"". Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: ""This year's increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.
""If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justify spending a penny on the royals."" ""Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw PS2.4million at a new house for Harry.""
The royals' carbon emissions almost doubled -- mainly due to royal air travel. Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by 93 percent year-on-year. This was blamed on the ""higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel"" and there were ""five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one in 2017-18"".
Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan. Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles' office said his overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two percent.

""Note her typical emotional ploy, using children to get her way. Except when she wants their lives ended,"" Ingraham said on ""The Ingraham Angle"" Monday in response to a clip of Pelosi taking credit for delaying President Trump's ICE raids.
""When I spoke to the President, I said 'Look, I'm a mom, I have five kids, seven, nine grandchildren and children are scared,'""Pelosi said Monday in New York.
""No one wants any child ever to be afraid, ever. It is tragic, and it really shouldn't happen. And kids of American criminals, they suffer here too because of the mistakes of their parents. And parents coming illegally, again tragic but now comes the consequences for the whole family sometimes.

The baby, Fayth Percy, was rushed to the hospital where she underwent surgery to remove bullet fragments from her head, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters. She is in critical but stable condition. 
The alleged shooting took place at a home in Fresno. A man there tried to grab the mother's hand but she rejected his advances, police said.
The mother later left the home with the baby another male friend, police said. As they were driving away, the suspect, Marco Antonio Echartea, 23, began shooting at the car, police said.
""At some point when he got close, he pulled out a handgun and fired three rounds into the driver's side window, which was up,"" Dyer said. ""One of those rounds struck baby Fayth on the side of the head as she was being held by her mother."" 
Police found the suspect near the home and arrested him on suspicion of three counts of attempted murder, the Fresno Bee reported. He was also wanted for another shooting in May. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney. No further details were released on the baby's condition.

Police responded to the home of Trivea Jones, 23, around 5:30 p.m. in Aurora, Ill., where they found her 6-month-old, the Chicago Sun Times reported. Police said Jones initially told officers that her son suddenly stopped breathing while she was feeding him but later allegedly admitted to the beating.
Officers tried to resuscitate the infant before rushing him to a hospital. Doctors determined that the boy suffered a fractured skull and severe trauma. The infant was airlifted to a Chicago trauma center where he was placed on life support. 
Jones was taken to Kane County Jail and booked on two felony charges of battery against an infant. Authorities are monitoring the condition of the child and may seek additional charges should his condition worsen, police said. No court date has been set.

45318235,424195,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Dudley Council,ORGANIZATION,887498,4,1,"An autistic boy who had his leg amputated is battling for a secondary school place after ""falling through the cracks"" of education provision.
Daniel Webster, 11, has missed school for two years due to illness and school refusal - also known as school phobia. 
Trina Webster said she had letters from mainstream and special schools saying they could not cater for his needs. 
Dudley Council said it was committed to giving children ""the means to reach their full potential.""
Mrs Webster, of Halesowen, spoke to the BBC after seeing Newsnight's investigation into why 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England.
Daniel was six when doctors found he had a tumour in his hip and thigh, said Mrs Webster. 
He was signed off from primary school in 2017 as medically unfit when he was given morphine and other drugs to manage the pain. 
In 2018, he had to have his leg amputated. 
""He had the operation in March but he was doing so well by May we wanted to see if he was ready to go back to school, but it was too soon. He started 'school refusing',"" said Mrs Webster. 
School refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.
He did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.
Now 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.
""Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,"" she said. 
""But they all turned us down. One said he would be isolated because there was no peer group for him. Another said his needs were too complex.""
Instead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. 
The family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. 
""I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,"" said Mrs Webster. 
""It's so frustrating. It's not just his physical needs, it's emotional too. We don't want him in a noisy, pressure-filled environment.""
Councillor Ruth Buttery, cabinet member for children and young people, said: ""Working in conjunction with health and education providers, we are determined to provide the best possible outcomes for pupils with Send or additional health needs and we have recently appointed two specialist education officers to support and advice parents and carers.""

Daniel Webster, 11, has missed school for two years due to illness and school refusal - also known as school phobia. 
Trina Webster said she had letters from mainstream and special schools saying they could not cater for his needs. 
Dudley Council said it was committed to giving children ""the means to reach their full potential.""
Mrs Webster, of Halesowen, spoke to the BBC after seeing Newsnight's investigation into why 1,500 children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are without a school place in England.
Daniel was six when doctors found he had a tumour in his hip and thigh, said Mrs Webster. 
He was signed off from primary school in 2017 as medically unfit when he was given morphine and other drugs to manage the pain. 
In 2018, he had to have his leg amputated. 
""He had the operation in March but he was doing so well by May we wanted to see if he was ready to go back to school, but it was too soon. He started 'school refusing',"" said Mrs Webster. 
School refusal is a recognised psychological condition in which children develop an inherent fear of attending school. Daniel also suffers with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that affects the ability to speak and communicate.
He did not return to primary school but has been been receiving tuition from Cherry Tree Learning Centre, which helps children who have emotional and physical needs.
Now 11, he is due to start secondary school in September, and Mrs Webster said she applied to several special needs schools.
""Mainstream schools will be noisy and too much pressure for him,"" she said. 
""But they all turned us down. One said he would be isolated because there was no peer group for him. Another said his needs were too complex.""
Instead, the Websters were told Daniel had a place at Earls High School in Dudley. Mrs Webster said the school had previously told her it did not have the facilities to cater for her son. 
The family will now attend a tribunal in July at Dudley Council to try to find Daniel a suitable place at a special school. 
""I'm not sending him to a school where he's going to fail, where he's not going to cope,"" said Mrs Webster. 
""It's so frustrating. It's not just his physical needs, it's emotional too. We don't want him in a noisy, pressure-filled environment.""
Councillor Ruth Buttery, cabinet member for children and young people, said: ""Working in conjunction with health and education providers, we are determined to provide the best possible outcomes for pupils with Send or additional health needs and we have recently appointed two specialist education officers to support and advice parents and carers.""

45363429,424502,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Nice,ORGANIZATION,6948,10,1,"A law protecting allergy sufferers will be introduced following the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse.
The teenager died after an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette. 
Under ""Natasha's law"", food businesses will have to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food. 
Natasha's parents said ""helping save other allergy sufferers and their families from the enduring agony that we will always bear is a fitting legacy for her life.""
Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the couple were an ""inspiration"". 
""These changes will make food labels clear and consistent and give the country's two million food allergy sufferers confidence in making safe food choices,"" he said. 
The law, which will apply to England and Northern Ireland, is set to come into force by the summer of 2021.
Businesses will be given a two-year implementation period to adapt to the changes. 
Natasha, 15, suffered a severe allergic reaction after eating sesame in an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought in Heathrow Airport.
She died of anaphylaxis after collapsing on board a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016.
The coroner looking into her death said Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging.
Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"" and said it would be listing all ingredients on its freshly made food.
A spokesman said: ""Full ingredient labels are now in over 60 Pret shops as part of our nationwide rollout. 
""Before we took this step, we ran a number of pilots to confirm that this approach would be safe, practical and effective.
""We are pleased that the Government has chosen to support full ingredient labelling.""

45365218,424505,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Chicago Police,ORGANIZATION,52424,3,1,"Video recorded on a police bodycam from the night Jussie Smollett was allegedly attacked has been released.
The ex-Empire actor says he was punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck in a racist and homophobic attack in January.
But Chicago Police say he staged the whole thing. 
They've released footage from the night where Smollett appears to have the rope still around his neck. 
The footage shows two police officers going to Smollett's apartment building in Chicago at around 8:43 in the morning - almost seven hours after the alleged attack.
They are met by Frank Gatson, who introduces himself as Jussie Smollett's ""creative director"". 
He tells the police: ""I work with him. He is like a star, works on the show Empire. So I think he doesn't want it to be a big deal.""
He adds that he's emotional because the attackers put a makeshift noose around Jussie Smollett's neck.
Once the police get into the apartment, they see Smollett with a thin white rope around his neck.
One officer says: ""Do you want to take it off or anything?""
Smollett replies: ""Yeah I do, I just wanted you to see it.""
He takes it off and adds: ""There's bleach on me. They poured bleach on me.""
Shortly after, they ask the police to switch off their cameras.
The footage is part of hundreds of files released by Chicago Police from their investigation into the case. 
Another video appears to show Abel and Ola Osundairo - who are accused of helping to stage the alleged attack - in a cab on the night the police were called.
Police say the two brothers were paid by Jussie Smollett to pose as the racist and homophobic attackers.
They were arrested two weeks later and started cooperating with the police. They say they helped stage the attack.
Jussie Smollett was believed by police at first, but was then himself arrested about three weeks after the alleged attack.
He was charged with filing a false police report.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"".
A judge said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose - which symbolises the historical racist hangings of black people in the US.
Smollett was suspended from Empire, and later it was confirmed he wouldn't return for the show's final season.
But about a month after he was arrested, all the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped.
Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, who decided to drop the charges, told CBS he still thought Smollett was guilty.
But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie forfeited a $10,000 (PS7,600) bond payment and carried out community service.
Then Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emmanuel called the decision ""a whitewash of justice"".
Mr Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the saga.
Chicago Police still thought Smollett was guilty, even though the charges were all dropped. 
On 29 March, they ordered him to pay $130,000 (PS99,000) to cover the cost of police officers, including overtime worked on the case.
Two weeks later, after he had refused to pay, he was sued for ""three times"" that amount by the City of Chicago.
In April, Jussie Smollett's legal team was sued for defamation by the Osundairo brothers - who said their reputations were damaged by the incident.
Smollett's lawyers - Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian - described the lawsuit as ""comical"" and ""ridiculous"".
Then, on 21 June, a Chicago judge ordered a special prosecutor to examine the handling of Smollett's claim.
This sets up the possibility he could be criminally charged a second time, a police spokesman said.

The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. 
He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". 
Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need.""
""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added.
Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. 
""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said.
""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. 
Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. 
The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. 
The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. 
His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.

His pledge comes after warnings of a funding black hole of at least PS7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.
There has not been a full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review, looking at future defence challenges and capabilities, since 2015 and one is expected in 2020.

In the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.
There are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?
Her suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?

45261501,423886,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Home Office,ORGANIZATION,7659,24,1,"""He brought out a knife and lunged at me,"" said Burhan, a teenager who came to the UK seeking safety.  
Burhan - not his real name - arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry, aged 16. 
But authorities did not believe he was a child and instead placed him into the adult system, where he says he was attacked.
He is one of 137 child asylum seekers - identified by Newsnight - that have been wrongly classified as adults. 
Between January 2018 and March 2019, these children were sent into adult accommodation, only for authorities to later accept they had been telling the truth about their age. 
Using the Freedom of Information act, Newsnight identified 26 cases in Derby, and 29 in Cardiff. Another nine were identified in Birmingham, 56 in Liverpool, eight in Croydon, seven in Wakefield and two in Glasgow. 
These cities are the UK's seven regional hubs for processing asylum seekers.
Burhan - whose identity Newsnight is protecting - is from a troubled area of the Middle East. 
""I was in the lorry for three days. I had no food and only a little water, which ran out quickly,"" he said.
""When I got off the lorry, I went to a petrol station and asked for the police.""
Burhan was originally treated as a child, but then social services visited him to say they believed he was in fact 20, not 16. 
""I said 'no - you're wrong',"" Burhan recalled. ""They said if you don't go, we will call the police and the police will take you by force.
""I felt so powerless because no matter how many times I explained to them, they didn't want to believe me.""
Classed as an adult asylum seeker, he was sent to live in a room in a house with other asylum seekers, older than him. 
It was there, Burhan said, an older man kicked his bedroom door down and attacked him.
""He had a plate in his hand and he smashed it on my head,"" he said. ""My eyesight was blurry and I couldn't see. He brought out a knife... he lunged at me, but I managed to avoid it and ran away.
""I was very scared and I was shivering. I ran away with no clothes on, not even shoes. I only came back after the police had arrested him.""
In 2018, almost 3,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers arrived in the UK claiming to be under 18. It's widely accepted that some will be adults posing as children.
Last year, man who posed as a 15-year-old in Ipswich was thought to be as old as 30.
If asylum seekers are deemed to be children, they have more access to education and a better chance of being allowed to settle in the UK. 
After eight months, Burhan's case was reviewed by independent social care workers and it was judged that he was a child. 
""When they said I was a child, it was mixed feelings. I was happy that finally somebody believed me but I was upset that they wasted my time and they made me feel terrible,"" Burhan said. 
He is now learning English at college and is staying in appropriate accommodation. 
Labour Peer and former refugee Lord Dubs told Newsnight that cases such as Burhan's, when the Home Office does not believe someone is a child, are the ""harshest"".
""This is not helped by the fact that refugees have often been scrutinised by the media for looking older,"" he added.  
""We must not forget that these people have been on terrific journeys, and that they therefore probably look older given what they have endured."" 
In May, a case was brought before the Court of Appeal and judges ruled the process by which age was assessed was unlawful. 
Now, anyone appearing under the age of 25 will be referred to specialist local authority age assessors. 
The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by this judgement. 
""We take our duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the asylum and immigration system very seriously. However, age assessment is an extremely difficult area of work and is not an exact science,"" a Home Office spokesman said.
""Our approach seeks to strike an important but sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are appropriately supported whilst at the same time maintaining the integrity of the asylum system and preventing adults passing themselves off as children.""

In 2018, almost 3,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers arrived in the UK claiming to be under 18. It's widely accepted that some will be adults posing as children.
Last year, man who posed as a 15-year-old in Ipswich was thought to be as old as 30.
If asylum seekers are deemed to be children, they have more access to education and a better chance of being allowed to settle in the UK. 
After eight months, Burhan's case was reviewed by independent social care workers and it was judged that he was a child. 
""When they said I was a child, it was mixed feelings. I was happy that finally somebody believed me but I was upset that they wasted my time and they made me feel terrible,"" Burhan said. 
He is now learning English at college and is staying in appropriate accommodation. 
Labour Peer and former refugee Lord Dubs told Newsnight that cases such as Burhan's, when the Home Office does not believe someone is a child, are the ""harshest"".
""This is not helped by the fact that refugees have often been scrutinised by the media for looking older,"" he added.  
""We must not forget that these people have been on terrific journeys, and that they therefore probably look older given what they have endured."" 
In May, a case was brought before the Court of Appeal and judges ruled the process by which age was assessed was unlawful. 
Now, anyone appearing under the age of 25 will be referred to specialist local authority age assessors. 
The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by this judgement. 
""We take our duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the asylum and immigration system very seriously. However, age assessment is an extremely difficult area of work and is not an exact science,"" a Home Office spokesman said.
""Our approach seeks to strike an important but sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are appropriately supported whilst at the same time maintaining the integrity of the asylum system and preventing adults passing themselves off as children.""

45261509,423886,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Home Office,ORGANIZATION,7659,30,2,"""He brought out a knife and lunged at me,"" said Burhan, a teenager who came to the UK seeking safety.  
Burhan - not his real name - arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry, aged 16. 
But authorities did not believe he was a child and instead placed him into the adult system, where he says he was attacked.
He is one of 137 child asylum seekers - identified by Newsnight - that have been wrongly classified as adults. 
Between January 2018 and March 2019, these children were sent into adult accommodation, only for authorities to later accept they had been telling the truth about their age. 
Using the Freedom of Information act, Newsnight identified 26 cases in Derby, and 29 in Cardiff. Another nine were identified in Birmingham, 56 in Liverpool, eight in Croydon, seven in Wakefield and two in Glasgow. 
These cities are the UK's seven regional hubs for processing asylum seekers.
Burhan - whose identity Newsnight is protecting - is from a troubled area of the Middle East. 
""I was in the lorry for three days. I had no food and only a little water, which ran out quickly,"" he said.
""When I got off the lorry, I went to a petrol station and asked for the police.""
Burhan was originally treated as a child, but then social services visited him to say they believed he was in fact 20, not 16. 
""I said 'no - you're wrong',"" Burhan recalled. ""They said if you don't go, we will call the police and the police will take you by force.
""I felt so powerless because no matter how many times I explained to them, they didn't want to believe me.""
Classed as an adult asylum seeker, he was sent to live in a room in a house with other asylum seekers, older than him. 
It was there, Burhan said, an older man kicked his bedroom door down and attacked him.
""He had a plate in his hand and he smashed it on my head,"" he said. ""My eyesight was blurry and I couldn't see. He brought out a knife... he lunged at me, but I managed to avoid it and ran away.
""I was very scared and I was shivering. I ran away with no clothes on, not even shoes. I only came back after the police had arrested him.""

Monday's findings are ""presumed to be associated with"" with a right pelvic bone and femur that a dog dug up in Seneca, S.C. last week, Addis said. The bones were studied by forensics experts who determined that they belonged to a woman, aged 25 to 45, who had died within the last few months, The State reported. 
The findings prompted a ""large-scale search of the area,"" using cadaver dogs. Police said Monday's remains were found in a nearby creek just as a team of 35 searchers was being recalled. 
A coroner is examining the remains, police said in a news release. A sample has been sent to a forensics lab to compare its DNA with ""known missing persons,"" the coroner said in a news release. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday.

Rocco Morabito, 52, was the alleged leader of Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, Italy's most powerful organized crime group and one of the largest European importers of cocaine from South America, UK's Independent newspaper reported. 
Uruguay's interior ministry confirmed Monday that Morabito escaped through a hole in the roof of the Central Prison in Uruguay's capital Montevideo on Sunday with three other inmates and robbed the owners of a local farmhouse before fleeing. 
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini told Sky News that he'll be ""asking for immediate explanations from the Montevideo government"" after Morabito's ""disconcerting and serious"" escape from jail. ""We will continue to hunt down Morabito, wherever he is, to throw him in jail as he deserves,"" Salvini said. 
He was arrested in a Montevideo hotel in 2017 after living in Uruguay for 13 years under a fake name, Sky News reported. He used a Brazillian passport to pose as a soybean farmer and real estate salesman, the report said.
Morabito was convicted of mafia association, drug trafficking and other serious crimes in Italy in 1994 after completing a $7.9 million deal to import almost a ton of cocaine into Italy. He escaped the country before authorities put him in jail and had been on the run for 23 years prior to his 2017 arrest, reports said

Barry Postman, Woods' attorney, said in a statement obtained by Fox News that the decision by Nicholas Immesberger's parents to drop Woods from the suit was ""clearly appropriate.""
""While the situation was tragic, the facts will ultimately show that the cause of Mr. Immesberger's car accident were the many decisions made by Mr. Immesberger on the night of his passing,"" the statement read.
The lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County last month alleged that before the crash, Immesberger, a bartender at The Woods in Jupiter, Fla., was over-served for about three hours after his shift at the restaurant was over.
Woods is an investor in the restaurant. His girlfriend, Erica Herman, the general manager, is still named in the suit, along with the restaurant, The Washington Post reported.
The amdended suit claims that Herman recruited Immesberger as a bartender there despite knowing he was an alcoholic. It alleges restaurant employees, managers and owners let Immesberger drive after being over-served alcohol.
The initial lawsuit claimed, ""Tiger knew, or reasonably should have known, that Immesberger was habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages, and/or was a habitual drunkard.""
The amended lawsuit--filed last week by the parents--no longer names Woods.

Hannity played a multitude of clips highlighting what he felt were the more extreme elements the Democratic presidential candidates were promising and he went after South Bend, Ind.

Hannity  warned his viewers the that Democrats have moved even further left and want to take the country in a direction beyond even what the Obama administration had wanted to.
""Instead of sticking to any principles real agenda real policy that will help the forgotten men and women that got destroyed under the Biden-Obama economy, the extreme left now has gone further out to the fringe pandering to every corner of the Democratic Party,"" Hannity said.
The host blasted candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for supporting reparations for gay Americans and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., for saying he would meet with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.

Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.
The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.
The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.
Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.
Esper said Monday the department's priorities would ""remain unchanged"" and everything the department did ""should support its stated objectives."" 
He then went on to explain ""three mutually reinforcing lines of effort"" used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""
In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the ""surest way to deter adversary aggression"" and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it's important to ""continue to build readiness to fight"" while ""modernizing key capabilities for future conflict."" 
Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners ""play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world."" He added that through continued engagement the country will ""grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability."" 
Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.
He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.
Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.
""Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,"" Esper wrote in the memo. ""This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive."" 
He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and ""always do the right thing.""

45295105,424082,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,House Intelligence Committee Ranking,ORGANIZATION,625260,1,1,"House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes has called on British ex-spy Christopher Steele to be interviewed to answer key questions on the anti-Trump dossier.
Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.
""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.
""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""
Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.
Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.
On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""
Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.
""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.
""The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.""

In a Fox News interview on Friday, lawyer Norm Pattis said his client, Fotis Dulos, was ""emotional, tired, distraught"" over the ""exhausting ordeal"" and disappearance of his estranged wife.
He said Jennifer Dulos ""had a troubled past,"" describing her as a writer who ""wrote a manuscript similar to 'Gone Girl,'"" a thriller that later became a hit Hollywood movie.
In response, Carrie Luft, a spokeswoman for family and friends of the missing mother, said: ""This is not fiction or a movie. This is real life, as experienced every single day by Jennifer's five young children, her family, and her friends.""
She continued, ""We are heartbroken. Jennifer is not here to protect her children, and these false and irresponsible allegations hurt the children now and into the future.""
Luft added, ""Evidence shows that Jennifer was the victim of a violent attack in her New Canaan home.""
Jennifer Dulos was reported missing on May 24 and was last seen driving a black Chevy Suburban as she dropped off her children at their private school in New Canaan.
The couple was in the midst of a bitter custody battle over the five children. Pattis said Jennifer Dulos ""seemed intent"" on moving the children to New York, where her mother lived, against the joint custody agreement.
""She was not settled happily in New Cannan, intending to live there happily ever after,"" Pattis said.
However, court documents revealed Jennifer Dulos was ""terrified for [her] family's safety."" She alleged that her husband, a custom home builder who was born and raised in Greece but went to college at Brown University in the U.S., ""has a history of controlling, volatile and delusional behavior.""
Luft said Pattis' suggestion that Jennifer Dulos' disappearance was tied to a book she wrote was nonsensical.
""I read Jennifer's novel in installments as she was completing the manuscript,"" Luft said. ""She finished the draft around 2002. (This was before she was dating Fotis Dulos.) Her book has nothing to do with Gone Girl (published in 2012).""
She added, ""Jennifer's novel is not a mystery. It's a character-driven story that follows a young woman through relationships and self-discovery over a period of years. Like all of Jennifer's writing, it expresses a deep longing for human connection and the need to be accepted as one's true self.""
Fotis Dulos and his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, both pleaded not guilty to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution earlier this month.
Fotis Dulos' DNA was found mixed with his wife's blood on a kitchen faucet in the New Canaan home where she lived with her children after the couple split, according to State's Attorney Richard Colangelo. Police said the house also had evidence of blood spatter and cleanup attempts, according to the arrest report.
Pattis said he remained skeptical of the state's evidence against his client, which also included surveillance footage of a man resembling Fotis Dulos and Troconis making 30 stops in a vehicle and dumping clothing, sponges and other items, which investigators said have tested positive for the missing mom's DNA at some of those stops.
He said he had not seen the state's security footage but said he had ""reasons to doubt that it's reliable.""
Pattis released a statement on Monday writing, ""We are continuing our investigation of Ms. Dulos's disappearance, and believe it to be entirely consistent with the evidence to conclude that she was not a victim of foul play at the hands of third parties.""
He continued, ""Efforts to distance Ms. Dulos from a Gone Girl-type scenario are well-meaning, to be sure. But the fact remains that Ms. Dulos remains accountably 'Gone,' and had the imagination, means and motive to disappear.""

On Monday, Fox News' Geraldo Rivera and Juan Williams discussed Buttigieg's handling of the town hall and his cities unhappiness regarding race relations and the police department.
""The black one-third of South Bend has apparently turned against the mayor. He's had an incredible run, Mayor Pete has, but I think that the rubber has met the road,"" Rivera said on ""The Story with Martha MacCallum.""
A town hall Sunday became chaotic as the city struggled to respond to a deadly police-involved shooting last week that that highlighted a disconnect between African-American residents and Buttigieg.
Rivera suggested Buttigieg's candidacy is likely to end in South Carolina after the recent controversy.
""It seems to me that unless he can turn this around, his candidacy will hit South Carolina and end there, seems to me. He's not being accepted by the African-American community,"" Rivera said.
Williams agreed with Rivera's assessment, saying Buttigieg is looking like he's ""small town mayor"" -- not presidential.

 ""I think Pete Buttigieg is proving to be a guy from a small town, a small town mayor. If he doesn't deal with this crises, it's a terrible sign for someone who says he wants to handle the nation,"" Williams said.
Williams also compared Buttigieg's controversy to former Vice President Joe Biden's recent blowback from saying that he was able to work with segregationists senators, saying it wasn't ""as serious as what Pete Buttigieg is going through.""

Mexico promised earlier this month to send 6,500 National Guard agents to its southern border, but Monday's announcement was the first public acknowledgment of deployments to the U.S. border.
At a news conference in the Caribbean city of Cancun, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican forces were detaining migrants to prevent them from crossing the U.S. border. Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.
""Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,"" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.
Mexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.
Nuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.
Previous rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.
""It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,"" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. ""The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion). We will continue knocking on doors to find resources. The municipal government is overwhelmed.""
Rivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.
Thomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.
There have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.

""To date her family and her friends have not heard from her,"" Salt Lake City Police Assistant Chief Tim Doubt told reporters on Monday. 
""She missed a midterm exam and a flight and at this time there is no evidence that any harm has come to her, however, because of the circumstances of the case we want to make sure that she is alright."" 
Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.
Last Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.

He added, ""Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.""
Doubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. 
""Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,"" Doubt said. ""Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything."" 
The University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.
""The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie ""Kenzie"" Lueck and her family,"" the statement said. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.""
Lueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.
""Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,"" Doubt said. ""We just want to make sure you are safe and we will respect your wishes.""
Anyone with information on Lueck's disappearance was urged to contact the Salt Lake City Police Department.

Mackenzie Lueck, 23, was flying to Salt Lake City from Los Angeles after attending a funeral last weekend. The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.
Doubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. 
Doubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.
Lueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.

The Californian Democrat made the stunning claim during an interview with Axios that aired Sunday.
""I'm just hearing stuff that gins up a smaller and smaller base of people. And that's my point... California in the 1990s is a lot like America in 2019, 2020, 2021. And here's the real story -- The Republican party was walked off a cliff,"" Newsom said.
""They're third-party status. It's exactly what Donald Trump is doing and Mitch McConnell, who is completely complicit, is doing [to] the Republican party nationally. And they don't even know what's about to hit them.""
Newsom was asked about his perceived disconnection with middle America and Trump voters at large and said he grew up in a red, rural district which helps him understand the heartland.
""I spent 50 years of my life in rural California in one of the reddest parts of the state, in Placer County. We grew up with these folks, have deep respect for people in rural community [sic]. Deep,"" he said.
""I just don't want them to be lied to. I actually care about them. I'm not using them as a pawn. They're not being respected. They're being lied to. They're not connected to any movement. This guy -- you think Trump cares about them? He's a sole practitioner. You think they're being protected?""
Newsom said he has empathy for the GOP because they don't realize how far they're going to fall, as a result of their own actions.
""I honestly am empathetic towards what they are about to experience, which is a profound demise because of their own making,"" he said.
""And until you have some courageous Republicans that stand up and actually make an argument for conservatism... they are finished. They have no governing philosophy, they have no value system that's interesting except fear of others. And those others are going to be a majority. So wake up.""
Newsom also said the current political climate has only bred fear and anxiety and accused Trump of selling voters a bill of goods.
""We're actually ginning up more anxiety, more fear -- which makes communities less safe,"" he said.
""I mean they're getting a completely raw deal. They've been sold a complete bill of bulls--t. Excuse my language and forgive me... it's just a yarn of crap.""

45232272,423769,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Treasury,ORGANIZATION,4112,3,2,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""
The U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.
Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

Fox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.
Fox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.
The proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.
The legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has ""literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.""

In a Friday letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said his office would consider the matter as part of another audit that was about to get underway.
Schumer had asked the watchdog to look into the department's decision to delay the redesign, ""including any involvement by the White House."" In his original letter, he noted that ""during his campaign, President Trump referred to efforts to replace President Jackson's likeness on the front of the $20 note as 'pure political correctness.'""
The Senate minority leader said Monday he was ""pleased"" by the department's decision to conduct the review and added that he hoped it would be ""conducted in an expeditious fashion."" Delmar's letter indicated that the review would take ""approximately"" 10 months.
""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population"" Schumer added. ""The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""
The redesign initially was scheduled for 2020, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited.
""It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,"" Mnuchin told lawmakers at the time. ""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""
Last week, Mnuchin said suggestions that the process was being delayed deliberately were ""completely erroneous.""
Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849 and played a key role in the Underground Railroad. Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.

St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued  to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis time to take a licensing fight to perform abortions before an administrative panel.
Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside of court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.

The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.
""We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.
She said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, ""abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.""
Republican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.
""We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,"" he said in a statement.
The fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.
The state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three ""failed abortions"" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.
Missouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""
""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""
However, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.
""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""

""I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,"" Callaway said. ""It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.""
Vargas said Monday that the issue was ""an unfortunate distraction.""
""Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,"" Vargas told reporters. ""So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.""
The Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.

Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen announced the fines prior to the first game of a four-game series between the Mets and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey ""regrettable on many levels.""
""I think frustrations were high,"" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. ""And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.""
Callaway repeatedly called Healey a ""motherf---er"" after the reporter told the manager that he would ""see you tomorrow"" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would ""knock you the f--- out, bro"" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.
In a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.
""He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,"" Healey told the paper. ""I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.""
The Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: ""The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.""
""I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,"" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, ""and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.""
Callaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: ""I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.""

Captioned ""Sunshine Bikini for gloriously sunny LA,"" Hurley glowed as she rocked a yellow bikini top with a deep neckline, which she accented with heart-shaped sunglasses.
Hurley has been on a tear since ringing in her 54th birthday just two weeks ago. The mother of Damian Hurley -- an actor and budding fashion model himself -- has remained one of the industry's leading age-defying women and recently spilled the beans on how she remains in top shape.
""I think we have to stay active, whether it's formal exercise or just moving around a lot,"" the British model told Closer Weekly last month. ""I think we have to watch what we eat. We all know that. Everybody tells us that, but we have to watch what we eat.""
But while the Estee Lauder model admitted she isn't keen on partaking in diet fads, Hurley can't help herself when it comes to topping off her plate with a heap of vegetables -- something she said has helped her figure immensely over the years.
""I eat meat and fish, but I also eat a lot of vegetables, and I've been really trying in the last year that 50 percent of the foods I eat are vegetables,"" she told the outlet. ""It's not easy but I'm trying -- and I think it really makes a difference actually.""

For the current second tier, this may represent an opportunity for them to break out from a pack whose sheer size - and intense national schedule - makes this year more challenging for what we might charitably call campaign ""asterisks."" For the front runners and top tier challengers, these nights represent real risks of a blooper that could derail any of them, or an opportunity to address - directly - issues that have been raised about them.
The ""card"" for each night features ten candidates for two hours - with a panel of five NBC moderators. To limit size, the moderators will tag team, so each hour will have thirteen people on stage.
I reviewed each of the candidates to determine what they must do - or avoid doing - given the large audience that is likely to be watching:
My bet is that the news coming out of the first night will focus on how well Warren performs, with one or two soundbites from the others on stage. Those others need to plan to make sure they're one of those selected ""bites.""
Sanders' challenge is to keep his lead among the furthest left in the party, particularly in the face of recent Warren momentum. In 2016, against Hillary Clinton, he was easily able to represent the more progressive ranks of the party. But with Warren feeding a stream of detailed progressive plans, that's harder. His opportunity on Thursday is to articulate the rationale for his approach - and to embrace his ""Democratic Socialist"" positioning and solidify his support among the progressives. Unfortunately for Sanders - and also probably for NBC's ratings - the random candidate selection prevented what could have been a white-hot Sanders vs. Warren face-off.
Harris has often slipped in unscripted settings, but she continues to be formidable in fund raising. She needs to demonstrate her ability, and seek to capture the center of the party electorate, which is where she has historically been strong. Standing close to Biden and Sanders, she has an opportunity to try to attack Sanders for positions she feels are too progressive, and attack Biden for being too accommodating and naive with Republicans.
My bet for both nights: While the also-rans will seek attention, their sheer volume will enable each of the top front runners to maintain their status, and the race will continue to be a five-way campaign among Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, and Buttigieg.

In an Instagram post early Monday, Jackson reposted a photo of two side-by-side posters promoting his upcoming film ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" which depicted his character, Nick Fury, with his signature eye patch placed on two different eyes, rather than only the correct left eye.
""Uhhhhhhh, What In The Actual F-- IS GOING ON HERE???!!!,"" the actor captioned the picture, adding the hashtags, ""#headsgonroll #lefteyemuthafu--ah.""
The original photo was initially posted by an observant Marvel fan on Reddit, with the humorous title, ""Which eye did he injure?""
One Reddit user jokingly claimed, ""All this time Nick Fury has just been defrauding the government for disability.""
Another user quipped, ""Obviously, one of the pictures is actually a selfie which is why it's flipped compared to the other.""
Jackson's character of Nick Fury has remained a staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ever since his debut in the first ""Iron Man"" film in 2008. The origin of Fury's iconic eyepatch was revealed during a scene in the recent ""Captain Marvel,"" when Fury's eye was scratched by the film's fan-favorite cat, Goose.

45235418,423772,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,North County Police Cooperative,ORGANIZATION,879768,3,1,"A 26-year-old man from North Carolina has been charged with murder for shooting and killing a Missouri officer who was responding to a call in North St. Louis County on Sunday, police said Monday. 
Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.
""Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,"" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family.

45235440,423772,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant,ORGANIZATION,879770,7,1,"A 26-year-old man from North Carolina has been charged with murder for shooting and killing a Missouri officer who was responding to a call in North St. Louis County on Sunday, police said Monday. 
Bonette Kymbrelle Meeks, 26, has also been charged with armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. 
Officer Michael Langsdorf, who had been with the North County Police Cooperative for three months, was responding to a bad check report at a food market on Sunday when Meeks shot and killed him, police said. 
Police added that Meeks was trying to cash the bad check.
North County Police Cooperative Major Ron Martin, who introduced himself as a friend of Langsdorf's while holding back tears, told reporters on Monday he has known the officer for 20 years.
""Mr. Meeks was successful in executing a cop yesterday and a good one,"" Martin said. 
The North County Police Cooperative's chief, John Buchanan, told reporters that Langsdorf responded to Clay Wellston Food Market Restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from St. Louis, around 4:30 pm on Sunday and about five minutes later, a call came in for ""one of our officers down."" Langsdorf, 40, was pronounced dead at a St. Louis hospital about 40 minutes later.
Martin told reporters on Monday that when Langsdorf confronted Meeks inside the market ""a struggle ensued between both of them,"" adding that ""the entire incident was captured on surveillance video.""
Martin told reporters he watched the surveillance video and described what he saw. 
""At some point Officer Langsdorf was on top of Meeks. I don't know how looking at the video Mr. Meeks was able to do it, but he was able to pull a gun from his waistband, strike Officer Langsdorf on the side of the head a few times which caused Officer Langsdorf to be in kind of a daze and lose his hold on Mr. Meeks,"" Martin said. 
""Mr. Meeks was able to stand up and stand over Officer Langsdorf as Officer Langsdorf was on the ground, face down, stomach down,"" Martin continued. 
""Mr. Meeks had the gun in his hand, pointed the gun to the back, pointed the gun to the back of Officer Langsdorf's head and fired one shot,"" Martin said as he got emotional and his fellow officers consoled him.
Martin said after Meeks shot Langsdorf in the neck, Meeks fled on foot ""gun in hand"" and assisting officers caught him shortly thereafter.
Martin said that when Meeks was arrested, ""he was armed with the pistol he used to murder Officer Langsdorf."" 
Officer Langsdorf had 17 years of prior police experience, according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
""Michael was an outstanding officer. In his short time with our department, he has taken our young officers under his wing and was mentoring and guiding them,"" Buchanan told reporters on Monday.
He added, ""When we first met he said to me several times, 'All I wanted to be was a police officer and do police work. It was really all I knew how to do.' He told me that numerous times."" 
""He [Langsdorf] had a lot of police experience. You never would have thought that this type of police officer would have been put in that position but it happened,"" Martin told reporters on Monday. ""There's no such things as a routine call. This is the dangers that our police officers in this community face every day."" 
He added, ""I can tell you that Mike was a pretty big part of us even though he was here a short time.""
Martin told reporters that officers interviewed Meeks and ""ultimately he confessed to murdering Officer Langsdorf.""
""Meeks remains in custody with NO BOND ALLOWED,"" according to a post on the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook page.
Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.

Police said Meeks has an extensive criminal history and is a multi-convicted felon in North Carolina.
According to criminal records obtained by Fox News, Meek's criminal history includes numerous convictions for the possession or sale of narcotics.
""We never had an officer involved shooting in the four years we've been here and we've never had a police officer killed in the line of duty,"" Martin said. 
""It's tough to get a grasp on it all,"" he added. 
Langsdorf left behind two children, a fiance and his parents.
""The North County Police Cooperative asks that you continue to keep the family, friends and co-workers of PO [Police Ofiicer] Langsdorf in your thoughts and prayers,"" the North County Police Cooperative's Facebook post read.
Buchanan told reporters Monday that The North County Police Cooperative will offer support to Langsdorf's family.
""Our department is going to wrap our arms around you and support you through this difficult time,"" Buchanan said, addressing Langsdorf's family.

Appearing on ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile told host Sandra Smith that the party's opening debates on Wednesday and Thursday will see some candidates will ""get out of the so-called box,"" while others will ""prove that maybe this is not their time.""
The ex-DNC chair added that the candidates will be desperately searching for a way to make themselves stand out.
""As you all know, preparing for the debate, these candidates have to figure out a way to basically stand out. And, to also draw a contrast with each other,"" Brazile said.
Climate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or ""green"" plan to tackle the issue.
However, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.
In May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.
On Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.
That's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.
The Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.
""Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,"" Sanders said. ""The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.""
Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.
An impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: ""What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.""
""It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,"" the New Yorker said.
On ""America's Newsroom,"" Brazile said Americans ""want to hear solutions"" to the issue.""45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,"" Brazile noted.

Kekejian leaped into the driver's seat on top of Alicea and ordered him out of the vehicle, only for the suspect to begin driving away with the door open. The officer and the suspect fought as the cruiser struck a fence and porch.

Andrew and Karen Wilson, both now 59, were first introduced when they were ""practically forced"" together in school in 1971.
The couple was originally ""disappointed"" when they were told to sit next to each other in class -- because they ""were the two stragglers"" -- at Riversmead School, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England.
After a year, the pair grew close, becoming friends, but ""nothing happened"" and they went their separate ways after finishing school in 1976.
But now, over four decades later Karen and Andrew have tied the knot after they reconnected with each other over Facebook.
""So it took a while, 45 years, before I finally got the courage to ask Karen out on a date, but I finally got my girl,"" Andrew said.
""I quite fancied Karen at school but was way to shy to say anything,"" he added.
Karen, meanwhile, said she didn't even know Andrew liked her.
""I always thought he was so well put together but little did I know he actually liked me and was making an effort with me,"" Karen said. ""In second term, Andrew decided he liked me and I didn't mind spending another term with him. But because we were so young, you don't think about love at that age, you just want to be with your friends.
""And now I am so happy. It's just a dream come true. I can't believe something like this has happened to me.""
After losing touch years ago, Andrew moved to Texas, where he married and had two children, and Karen continued to live in Cheshunt, where she also was married and had two children.
However, they both divorced, and were living their single lives until they reconnected on Facebook in January 2017.
The pair said they would often chat ""for hours"" until Andrew ""picked up the courage"" and asked Karen on a date on February 28.
However, to Karen's surprise, Andrew arrived a day early to meet the woman who would soon become his wife.
""We hadn't met each other for 41 years and we just fell into each other's arms. I moved him in my house the first day he arrived here because we had already made a relationship over video call. We had so much chemistry,"" said Karen.
""We had arranged to meet for dinner on the 28th. But Andrew, in the meantime, was in contact with a friend of mine in California and she conspired for him to turn up a day early to surprise me.
""He got his sister to join the conspiracy and he said, 'Would you meet my sister on the Monday lunchtime, the day before we meet, because she's not in town when I'm in town and she [would] like to meet you?' So I turned at up at Marriott thinking I'm meeting his sister and this bouquet of lilies came towards me. It was Andrew.
""It couldn't have gone any better. I think if I had actually met him the day we were supposed to meet, I would have been a nervous wreck. But because it was the day before, I got surprised.""
Andrew proposed to Karen in June 2018 in Paris. They married on June 22, and are now on their honeymoon in Italy.
""I just want to say to all the women out there because careful what you wish for, because wishes do come true,"" Karen said.
""If you are 30, 40 or 50 and haven't found the right man yet, don't worry. You have to give it time.""

Pelosi said she was uncertain of President Trump's plan to fix America's immigration system, but claimed being in the country illegally was not grounds for deportation.
""So, that is really kind of what happened. [Trump] didn't say what he was going to do but, as the president said, 'oh, I'll let you know, I'll let you know.' [He] went into -- 'well, people broke the laws.' A violation of status is not a reason for deportation. That's just not so,"" she said.
An ICE official who spoke with Fox News did not address Pelosi's comments directly but pointed to 8 U.S. Code Section 1325 (and 1326 for re-entry), and said anyone found to have violated U.S. immigration laws may be arrested, detained and - if found removable by final order - removed from the United States.
Pelosi also spoke about Trump's proposed ICE raids, which have now been delayed for two weeks to, he said, give Congress additional time to find a solution to the southern border crisis. She called the operation uncivilized and questioned its purpose.

The boisterous songstress opened up in a big way about her life as it is today and in true Halsey fashion, leaving no topic unexamined -- including her bipolar disorder, her ongoing battle to remain sober, and being a survivor of sexual assault. 
Simply put, Halsey has seen an eyeful in her two decades of life.
""I know I'm just going to get f---ing depressed and be boring again soon,"" the 24-year-old told Rolling Stone of her manic and often unpredictable diagnosis in an interview published Monday. ""And I hate that that's a way of thinking. Every time I wake up and realize I'm back in a depressive episode, I'm bummed.""
Halsey, whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, said she was diagnosed as bipolar at age 17 following a suicide attempt. However, she says she now embraces who she is and everything her diagnosis comes with -- even if her mental state makes her more explosive and prone to doing ""crazy s---.""
After ""getting cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times"" and splitting with rapper G-Eazy for good, Halsey has a much clearer conscience and has seemed to find her purpose. She managed to stay atop the charts for 12 consecutive weeks with ""Closer,"" her collaboration with the Chainsmokers -- and also landed her a first number one solo single with ""Without Me,"" an ode to her breakup with the Bay Area emcee. 
In the lengthy artist profile, the ""Ghost"" performer who has been an advocate for survivors of sexual abuse said she recently confronted her abuser. The multiplatinum artist said the person who allegedly abused her ""took it seriously, went to rehab, sought therapy."" 
While she is glad she is now able to speak out about her difficult past, Halsey refuses to be categorized as a victim. ""I have worked way too f---ing hard to be quantified or categorized by something like that,"" she said.  ""Then I'm not 'Grammy-nominated pop star,' then I'm 'rape survivor,'"" she said with a tremor. 
""Uh-uh, no. Absolutely not,"" she added.
Halsey admitted that she had been in a dark place during her journey and said she has made massive changes in her life to correct the negative imbalances she carried. This started with letting go of the drugs and adjusting her drinking habits.
""I support my whole family,"" she said. ""I have multiple houses, I pay taxes, I run a business. I just can't be out getting f--- up all the time.""

45233224,423770,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Fox News,ORGANIZATION,1860,7,1,"The Dominican public health minister said in a radio interview Monday that the Maryland couple found dead last month in a hotel room at a luxury resort had pre-existing health problems and may have died after mixing prescription drugs and alcohol.
In response, the attorney for the couple's families called the minister's claim ""absolutely ludicrous.""
Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.
""The toxicological test will determine if there's alcohol, and narcotics and the amount,"" Sanchez Cardenas said. ""There's been talk about drug abuse,"" he added, noting it could be lethal if combined with alcohol. He added that ""they had pre-existing health issues.""
Sanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.
""Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,"" he said. ""Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.""
In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.
As Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.
Dominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.
In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack.""

Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.

Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.

In the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical ""pharmacy"" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as ""mysterious"" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.
Suero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.
Suero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.
At the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.
""It's a mystery,"" Bullock told WTOP. ""There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.""
Bullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.
""We need to find out what's going on and what happened,"" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.
Sanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as ""a ticking timebomb,"" adding that ""his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.""
Allen's family has disputed those conclusions.
The health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.
Her son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.
""We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,"" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. ""A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack.""

Public Health Minister Rafael Sanchez Cardenas noted more than once during the interview that the couple's May 30 deaths were extraordinary, given that they died almost ""simultaneously"" and that there was no sign of violence or foul play.

In a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists ""absolutely ludicrous."" 
Edward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.
Several medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.
Autopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was ""morbidly obese.""
FBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.
The news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.
Many of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.
The FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.
Among the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.

45159491,423618,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,University of Illinois,ORGANIZATION,5606,1,1,"A former University of Illinois doctoral student was convicted Monday of killing a visiting scholar from China after abducting her at a bus stop as she headed to sign an off-campus apartment lease.
Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.
The swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.
Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.
He and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: ""My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer."" He responds: ""Yeah. That's me.""
Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.
Christensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.
There are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.
Zhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.

Prosecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.
Jurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.
The judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.
Illinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.
The federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.
The defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.
Jurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.
His lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.
Christensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.
Zhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.
He and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: ""My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer."" He responds: ""Yeah. That's me.""
Christensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.
Christensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.
There are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.
Zhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.

Sam Edelman, 37, who owns a KFC outpost in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, wants it to be ""recognized as not just a fast food place,"" he said to Metro, despite the fact that the Michelin Guide does not publish in Australia.
""We use fresh chickens that are delivered into the store every day and hand breaded in our kitchen by our cooks. There is some skill involved,"" he continued.
Edelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called ""Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.""
According to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for ""a very good restaurant in its category""; two stars, a restaurant has ""excellent cooking, worth a detour""; for three, a restaurant must offer ""exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.""
""On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?"" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's ""Street Food"" series.
""My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,"" he added to Metro.
Edelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.
""We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,"" he said to Metro.
Edelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.
""I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,"" he said to Metro.
""Good food is for everyone,"" he added. ""Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'""

""My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,"" he added to Metro.
Edelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.
""We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,"" he said to Metro.
Edelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.

45382409,424540,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Instagram,ORGANIZATION,928,13,1,"When Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson isn't leaping from buildings or beating up bad guys in his blockbuster films, he's spending lots of quality time being a parent.
The legendary wrestler-turned-actor, whose new film ""Hobbs and Shaw"" drops in August, has played tons of loving dads on-screen in the past, but he's frequently proven himself to be a caring parent in the real world through many humor-filled stories posted to social media.
One such story occurred in November, when Johnson was ready to leave his Florida home to go to work, but was unexpectedly stopped by his 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine.
The actor posted the story to Instagram, where he described his daughter approaching him with a brush on his way out the door. Despite the actor's insistence on leaving for work, Jasmine remained determined to paint his father's face before he left. Johnson agreed, joking to his daughter that she could only choose colors that were ""flattering to my complexion.""
A similar father-daughter encounter happened last week when the ""Jumanji"" star was preparing for his morning workout. Although Johnson wanted to maintain his daily routine, Jazzy had other ideas, and asked for assistance in building her new Barbie dollhouse instead.
""Of course, I can [build it] sweetheart - daddy can do anything, but let's get mommy because she's awesome at this and wanted to personally put it together for you.""
Some Instagram commenters claimed this was an instance of Johnson skipping out on helping his daughter, but others took the post as a lighthearted joke, with one commenter chiming in, ""Let me know if you need a contractor's help!""
The ""Fast and Furious"" actor also shared a window into his life as a father last month, while celebrating his 47th birthday at home in Florida. He posted an Instagram photo depicting him holding his two infant daughters, Tia and Jasmine, in both arms, saying they are a ""good reminder for me of what's really important in life and why I work the way I do.""
Aside from face painting and dollhouse building, the actor is also determined to teach his daughters important life lessons.
Perhaps one of Johnson's most profound dad stories came in 2016 when Jazzy was only a year old. To celebrate Labor Day, the actor revealed what he called an ""amazing philosophical conversation"" with his daughter, dealing with the values of hard work and respect.
""I told her, 'Baby girl when you grow up, you get out there and dent the universe thru hard work and sweat. And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect,'"" Johnson posted. ""She responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favorite game, 'Drum time on daddy's big head.' It was a good talk.""
Aside from his two youngest daughters, Johnson also makes sure to devote time to his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Simone.
Last month, Johnson announced on Instagram that Simone had graduated from high school, and is looking forward to her future college life at New York University. ""I love you and one day you'll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses,"" he wrote. The post also included a photo of Simone hilarously dodging a kiss from her father.
Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love.""

Johnson also made sure to honor his longtime partner, Lauren Hashian, in a lengthy Mother's Day tribute last month, deeming her to be ""the anchor of our blessed family.""
""If you got a good mom then you have real shot at life to becoming a good human being,"" Johnson wrote. ""As a father and man, I find the greatest peace and gratitude in knowing our baby girls here, Jazzy & Tia have this incredible woman's motherly love.""

45117344,423455,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,HBO,ORGANIZATION,5436,2,2,"Alexander Skarsgard opened up about working on some intense abusive and sexual scenes with ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Nicole Kidman.
For better or worse, Skarsgard's Perry Wright looms large over the plot of the show, even in its ongoing Season 2. His character is locked in an abusive but steamy relationship with Kidman's character, forcing them to go to dark, emotional and violent places to achieve some of the HBO drama's most important scenes.
Speaking on KISS FM's ""Kyle and Jackie O Show"" Skarsgard opened up about the difficulty he and Kidman had on set trying to film some of their more intense moments, giving her full credit for why they worked.
""I mean, it was extraordinary to work with Nicole. She's not only an incredible actress but she's also like the most lovely and generous and sweet woman. So of course, shooting those scenes were horrible. Absolutely horrible.""
He revealed that a stunt double was brought in for his co-star, but she refused to use them.
""Nicole and I had some time together to build up that trust before shooting those scenes which was crucial to have, because again, some of them are very violent and very physical and very psychologically draining,"" he revealed. ""She is incredibly committed and we did have a body double, like a stunt double on set, for you know, when I throw her over chairs and stuff and when it gets really violent, and Nicole wanted to do it herself.""
He even said the process left Kidman bruised at times. However, he credited his co-star's commitment to making the scene authentic for the positive response it received from viewers. Rather than cut in and out of the action to accommodate a stunt double, they were able to stay in their heightened emotional places for one long take.
The scenes had an extra layer of difficulty for the stars as Kidman's husband, Keith Urban, was known to watch everything.
""He's unbelievably supportive and watches all the episodes and cheers on from the sidelines which, I have to say, if I didn't have that I wouldn't be able to do it, I seriously wouldn't,"" she shared with News.com.au at the New York City premiere of Season 2.

Bethlehem is Jesus' birthplace, according to Christian tradition. The font is estimated to date back to between 501 and 600 A.D.
Ziad al-Bandak, head of a Palestinian presidential committee leading the church renovation, said Saturday that international experts are arriving in the biblical West Bank town to examine the receptacle.
Al-Bandak described the Byzantine font as a ""magnificent"" discovery that had been covered by the larger known vessel.
A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Church of the Nativity is located about 6.2 miles south of Jerusalem. The church is built on the site identified as Jesus' birthplace by Christian tradition.
A restoration project was launched five years ago to overcome decades of neglect at the historic church.
Palestinian news agency WAFA reports that a ceremony to celebrate the end of the restoration project, which was planned for November, has been pushed back to May 2020. The postponement will allow the three churches in charge of the Church of the Nativity to undertake a restoration of the church's grotto, WAFA reports.
In a separate project at the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, archaeologists have been hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.

The A-lister, 72, is to visit Manchester, London and Birmingham to share ""untold stories"" and promote his final Rambo film ""Last Blood.""
The black-tie dinner, called ""An Evening with Sylvester Stallone"" which takes place across three dates in August and September, will see a live stage interview, a three-course dinner, film prop models and an auction selling signed memorabilia.
The cheapest packages start at $160 a ticket but go up to $1,081 for the ""premium photo experience"" which allows film buffs to get a selfie with the man himself.
But fans have hit out on social media at the cost.
One said: ""It's a shame you'd need to sell a kidney to go."" Another joked on Facebook: ""Would love to go but PS500 for a photo. Would want a neet oot [night out on the town] with him for that and him buying the beers."" In response, the official ""An Experience With"" account defended the high prices.
They said: ""As with any business there are costs involved and this is the same for us as a company.
""When you take into consideration the costs to bring a celebrity of such status to the UK then you would understand why.
""As for the photos we are allowed only 150 from management so due to this, the exclusivity dictates the price.
""We work with A-list celebs and unfortunately quality costs."" The same event with Arnold Schwarzenegger charges fans the same, while a selfie with Mel Gibson is cheaper at $828.
They have both sold out but tickets are still available to see Sylvester Stallone.

The plan worked, but created another problem: Oregon now has way more pot than its 4 million residents can ever possibly hope to smoke. 
According to a 2019 Oregon Liquor Control Commission report, there are about 2,100 grower licensees in the state with enough weed currently on the market that it would take an estimated 6.5 years to sell it all within Oregon without any more production. The glut of marijuana has driven the price of marijuana down and left Oregonians wondering how they'll handle the weed windfall. 
In an attempt to remedy the state's cannabis conundrum, lawmakers in Oregon signed off on two news bills in the last week that would, respectively, cut down on excessive cultivation of marijuana and find new markets for the state's budding pot industry. 
Senate Bill 218 hands the Oregon Liquor Control Board more authority in issuing new licenses to growers based on the supply and demand for weed, while Senate Bill 582 lays the groundwork to eventually allow the governor to enter into agreements with other states for the importing and exporting of marijuana. 
It is currently illegal to transport marijuana across state borders so any moves from the governor's mansion in Salem would have to wait until lawmakers in Washington D.C. decide to make drastic changes to the nation's drug laws - a situation that seems unlikely given the Trump administration's less-than-friendly stance toward legal marijuana.

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done.

Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.
""We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. ""We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.""
Clegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created ""the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.""
Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.
""So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,"" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.

45118173,423456,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,GOP,ORGANIZATION,3431,3,1,"President Trump on Monday unveiled a new online fundraising site to give his re-election campaign and other Republicans running in 2020 a new platform to compete with the Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations.
""I am pleased to announce the launch of tmagac.winred.com,"" the president announced Monday on Twitter. ""This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!""
The new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.
While the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.
That advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.
The launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.
WinRed is part of ""The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,"" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's ""a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').""
The president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.
A Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million.

45161106,423619,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,National Student Clearinghouse Research Center,ORGANIZATION,885218,6,4,"Four years after President Obama proposed making community college tuition-free, free college proposals are all the rage among the Democratic presidential candidates. From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.
The logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.
The argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.
Therefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.
Although the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.
Free college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Yes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.
According to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.
A challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.
Doubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.
A second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.
Although college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.
The way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.
These disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.
For example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.
Instead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, ""Choosing College,"" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.
Policymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.
College will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment.

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., plan to Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., nearly every candidate boasts some version of a free college proposal.
The logic is as alluring as it is faulty. Free college would ultimately curtail students' ability to make the right choices for themselves, by crowding out the emerging innovative options most likely to make a difference in their lives.
The argument in support of free college goes something like this: College costs a lot, and far too many cannot afford those costs. Completing college has significant benefits for individuals in the form of a 14 percent return on investment and, theoretically, for society in terms of more skilled and knowledgeable individuals.
Therefore, advocates say, free college would automatically benefit students and society in the same way that extending high schools from the domain of the elite few - only one-third of children in the United States who enrolled in the first grade made it to high school in 1905 - to publicly funded settings for all did.
Although the analogy is tempting, following its logic would stunt the kind of innovations in higher education we need to bolster the nation and the livelihood of millions.
Free college would not solve our problems because many students who attend college do not finish. Forty percent of first-time, full-time students fail to graduate from four-year programs within six years. The rate is worse at two-year colleges, where only 39 percent of students complete. Eighty percent entering community colleges expect to transfer and earn a Bachelor's, but just 29 percent do within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Yes, financial hardship is one of the reasons students leave school. But it is not just tuition - which is what most free college plans address -driving students' financial challenges. If that were the case, we would expect to see far more success at low-priced community colleges where tuition is already covered completely for low-income students by the federal government's Pell Grants.
According to executives at ReUp Education, a company that helps re-enroll students who have dropped out and then supports them through graduation, factors like life balance, professional commitments, health, lack of satisfaction with one's school and academics all play significant roles in students dropping out as well.
A challenge is that colleges were never designed with the supports, flexibilities and instructionally sound teaching and learning practices that many students need to succeed. Some faculty members continue to view their teaching roles as sorting students out based on who cannot succeed academically, rather than supporting students through a course and viewing success as being how far they can take students regardless of academic preparation.
Doubling down by scaling existing colleges and universities that have flawed structures for the needs of today's students through free college policies does not make sense.
A second reason free college isn't the answer is that it does nothing to contain the true source of rising costs, which someone has to pay. Tuition has soared because traditional colleges lack economies of scale and have complex operational models that have led to significant cost increases. The pressure for costs to continue to rise in the traditional model is unrelenting.
Although college is more expensive than ever, the answer is not to allow individuals to afford a costly, subpar education, but to make a valuable education cheaper and more accessible.
The way to do that isn't by bending the cost curve of traditional programs, but by unleashing the power of disruptive innovation, which is just emerging in higher education in the form of faster and less expensive last-mile training and on-ramp providers, coding bootcamps, online programs and more.
These disruptive programs are at odds with the nation's historical strategy of making higher education accessible through massive spending to subsidize its cost. Continuing this strategy by writing a blank check will only slow the adoption of promising disruptive postsecondary programs like Western Governors University and Duet, as it will mask the full cost of traditional programs.
For example, although tuition at community colleges averages $3,347, the average spending per full-time student at a community college was $13,215 in 2016. Hiding these costs allows students to follow the conventional wisdom of going to college rather than seeking the most educational value for their time and money.
Instead, we need to support students by fostering a range of choices, from faster and cheaper options like Kenzie Academy and Lambda School to traditional colleges. In research for my forthcoming book, ""Choosing College,"" my co-author and I found that too many students in the more than 200 stories we documented chose college because it just felt like the logical choice that society expected them to make, rather than making a choice consistent with their circumstances and goals. A whopping 74 percent dropped out or transferred.
Policymakers could play a productive role by supporting policies that move beyond debt by clarifying the legality and adding consumer protection clauses around income share agreements that protect students from bad returns on investment, creating lifetime education savings accounts that empower individuals to make choices and avoiding cementing the stranglehold of traditional college in American society.
College will continue to be a viable option at different times in people's lives. But privileging that choice by making it free is the wrong way to tackle the college cost crisis and improve students' pathways to productivity and self-fulfillment.

Mutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Monday on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.
More than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.
Rebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.
Mutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.
""Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,"" he said.
""How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,"" he said. ""I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.""
The idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.
""We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,"" Redfield said.
Mutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.
The new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala. They talk about recognizing the early signs of Ebola, early treatment and prevention measures.

""Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,"" he said.
""How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,"" he said. ""I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.""
The idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.
""We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,"" Redfield said.
Mutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.
The new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala. They talk about recognizing the early signs of Ebola, early treatment and prevention measures.

Mutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Monday on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.
More than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.
Rebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.

Captain Robert Holzinger told FOX13 Tampa he was spearfishing with a friend 30 miles out when they spotted the whale shark. The friends jumped in the water, which was about 80 feet deep, to record the ""gentle giant."" Holzinger said they spent about an hour swimming with it.
The shark was estimated to be 20 feet long but Holzinger later told FOX4 the beast was 30 feet. He said the shark was friendly and allowed him to pet it.
Holzinger wrote on Facebook that he hoped that there would also be cobia - a scavenger fish that follows larger animals - but there weren't any.
""When we realized there wasn't we decided to swim and hang out with him for a while,"" he told FOX13 Tampa. ""It was truly a gift to be able to see and experience something like that.""
The endangered whale shark is the largest type of shark - and largest of all fishes - and can be found in tropical waters, according to the World Wildlife Fund. They can weigh as much as 11 tons and stretch as long as 40 feet long.
The filter feeders typically eat plankton and are described as ""gentle giants"" that ""sometimes allow swimmers to hitch a ride,"" according to National Geographic.

A new British automaker named Charge is now selling a battery-powered version of the classic American sports car. The company has teamed up with another startup named Arrival that has been developing an electric delivery van.
Charge's coupe mixes an officially-licensed aftermarket body with a 64 kilowatt-hour battery pack and four electric motors that put out a muscle car-like combined 469 hp and 885 lb-ft of torque.
Charge claims the all-wheel-drive car will be able to accelerate to 60 mph in under four seconds and cover 200 miles per charge. You can also switch it to rear wheel drive if burnouts and drifting are more your thing.
The interior features a modern take on the Mustang's iconic twin-brow dashboard, and has a digital instrument cluster along with large portrait-style infotainment screen hanging down between the seats above empty space where a transmission tunnel would normally be.
What it doesn't have is a pony-car style price. The high-tech creation is listed for the equivalent of $380,000, although it isn't currently available in the U.S.
That seems to be the going price for retro-electric Mustangs, however. A Russian company named Aviar Motors recently revealed a similar concept based on a Tesla Model S platform for $395,000.
Charge is limiting production to 499 cars and will debut its first production model at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on July 4.

Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.
""The Court's decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The Court's decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting SS924(c).""
Kavanaugh addressed the two recent cases Gorsuch referenced where laws were held to be vague, saying those laws applied to gun cases where defendants had committed violent crimes in the past. The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

The law in the current case adds harsher sentences for the same offense where the gun was used. As a result, he claimed, it makes sense to look at the specific offense.
""Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?"" he asked, calling this a ""gaping hole"" in the majority's analysis.
This case is the latest in several this term where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were at odds in close decisions.
Gorsuch sided in May with the court's liberal wing, giving a narrow majority in support of a Native American man convicted for hunting in a national forest. Kavanaugh opposed the ruling. A week earlier, Kavanaugh sided with liberals in a 5-4 decision that he wrote, ruling that Apple could be sued by iPhone owners over high prices in their App Store. Gorsuch opposed the ruling.

45038054,423291,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Congress,ORGANIZATION,387,8,2,"President Trump's two Supreme Court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were on opposing sides once again Monday in a case centering on whether a law that slaps harsher penalties on certain gun possession cases is unconstitutionally vague.
Gorsuch sided with liberal justices in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Davis, for which he wrote the opinion of the court. The law in question calls for longer sentences when a person uses a firearm in connection with a ""crime of violence,"" which is defined as a felony ""that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense."" That definition is rather confusing, Gorsuch said.
""Even the government admits that this language ... provides no reliable way to determine which offenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconstitutionally vague,"" he wrote. Vague laws leave it to unelected attorneys and judges to determine what acts qualify as crimes, Gorsuch said, when it is really Congress' job to make that decision with the laws that they pass.
In the current case, Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were convicted of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery under the Hobbs Act, which covers robbery, attempted robbery, or extortion affecting interstate commerce. They were each hit with longer sentences because robbery and conspiracy were found to be ""crimes of violence."" An appeals court found that the clause in the statute defining crimes of violence was unconstitutionally vague.
The Supreme Court's opinion referred to two recent cases where they struck down similar laws for being too vague. In those cases, when determining if a crime qualified as a ""violent felony"" or ""crime of violence,"" courts had to look at an ""ordinary case"" of such a crime, as opposed to what happened in the case in question.
The government argued that the courts should look at the specific case instead, but Gorsuch argued that an examination of the statute's text and history shows that Congress did not have a case-specific approach in mind. Therefore, he claimed the law is unconstitutional because it is too vague.
Kavanaugh penned a scathing dissent, where he was joined by the other conservatives. He warned of the repercussions the court's ruling could have.

The International Olympic Committee on Monday voted to hold the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.
Italy won the bid over Stockholm-Are, of Sweden, to host the Winter Games. It'll be the first time the Games will be held in Italy since Turin hosted in 2006.
Cortina d'Ampezzo, a ski town in northern Italy, hosted the Olympics in 1956. Sweden has never hosted the Winter Games, but Stockholm was the host of the 1912 Summer Games.
Both Italy and Sweden's bids made their final pitches to the IOC on Monday during a nine-hour meeting to choose a winner.
In their final presentations to win the bid from the IOC, the prime ministers of Italy and Sweden both pushed for their nations to host the 2026 games.
Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, noted that support in Italy is strong for an Olympic Games, and was a focal point of their bid. His presentation highlighted how 83 percent of the Italian population is in favor of the games, with 87 percent rising in Milan.
He said: ""If I am here today in front of you, it is thanks to the enthusiasm of all Italy. ... This is the dream of an entire country, and not only the government but also the regions.""
Sweden Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said, ""it's in our DNA"" to deliver a stable Winter Games after the IOC's own polling determined there was around 60 percent public backing in Sweden to host the games. The bid was challenged to prove its support from a Stockholm city authority coalition formed last October and a national government only five months ago.
The mayor of Stockholm, Anna Konig Jerlmyr, played up ABBA -- Sweden's most famous musical act -- telling the committee: ""ABBA is everywhere."" She then broke out into her own rendition of ""Dancing Queen.""

Schulman, 34, hosts the MTV series ""Catfish"" in which he investigates the stories of people who believe they are getting ""catfished"" by a nefarious, or lonely, person hiding behind a curtain of lies. Sometimes the stories end in heartbreak, but some end with genuine human connections. However, speaking to Fox News, Schulman made it clear that the one thing they all have in common is that they're all shocking in some way.
""It's interesting, I have made, I think now over 140 episodes of the show, and not any two have been alike. They've been similar in certain ways but there's always some unforeseeable, unpredictable twist that finds its way into the story whether it's at the beginning, middle or end,"" Schulman said. ""This last season that's airing now is no different. I think as the internet continues to evolve, and as we continue to figure out how we interact with it and use it and explore it, new stuff just keeps coming up.""
It's safe to say that, after more than 140 investigations and having once been the victim of a catfish himself, Schulman is an expert on sussing out frauds. Although he says social interactions are changing as quickly as technology is developing, there are some patterns that remain the same.
""It's funny, the nature of the relationships I see on 'Catfish' are all very specific. It's people who, for the most part, met as friends. Once in a while, it will start in a dating app, but usually it's unsuspecting,"" he explained. ""You're online, you get a 'friend request' from someone you don't really know, but you have some mutual friends so you say 'sure.' Then they start acting very friendly and you become enamored by them and flirtation leads to the next thing and before you know it, you're in a relationship.""
Schulman stops short of equating getting catfished exclusively with online dating because he's seen these deep  ""relationships"" develop out of friendship or an innocuous non-romantic conversation countless times. However, when it comes to ways to avoid getting catfished in 2019, the host says the basics haven't changed.
""Obviously you can get lied to or have a bad date. But the trouble is when you invest too much of yourself into a relationship that you haven't met,"" he explained. ""I would say the trend, or if people are going to online date, just know that if you're talking to someone for maybe, I don't know, a couple weeks, barring any strange circumstances like travel or work and they can't meet up with you... Something is probably off, and that's what you have to look out for.""
Schulman hosts a new crop of episodes debuting in June on MTV. Although he's going without his longtime co-host Max Joseph, who left the show in 2018, he's excited to get back out there and help some people.
""I am excited about this season of 'Catfish' for a lot of reasons. We went to some wild new places, we had things that have never happened happen to us and I have a bunch of really great co-hosts this season. Some you've seen before, some you haven't, who just bring incredible fresh energy to the show and we had a lot of fun. So, I think I want people to watch the show because there's a lot of TV you can watch that might not change the way you think about yourself, but our show pushes people to change the way they talk about one another in many ways.""

45046037,423297,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,MTV,ORGANIZATION,14098,8,1,"Nev Schulman was famously duped by someone pretending to be someone else in the documentary ""Catfish."" Now, he travels the country helping people avoid the same fate when it comes to meeting strangers online.
Schulman, 34, hosts the MTV series ""Catfish"" in which he investigates the stories of people who believe they are getting ""catfished"" by a nefarious, or lonely, person hiding behind a curtain of lies. Sometimes the stories end in heartbreak, but some end with genuine human connections. However, speaking to Fox News, Schulman made it clear that the one thing they all have in common is that they're all shocking in some way.
""It's interesting, I have made, I think now over 140 episodes of the show, and not any two have been alike. They've been similar in certain ways but there's always some unforeseeable, unpredictable twist that finds its way into the story whether it's at the beginning, middle or end,"" Schulman said. ""This last season that's airing now is no different. I think as the internet continues to evolve, and as we continue to figure out how we interact with it and use it and explore it, new stuff just keeps coming up.""
It's safe to say that, after more than 140 investigations and having once been the victim of a catfish himself, Schulman is an expert on sussing out frauds. Although he says social interactions are changing as quickly as technology is developing, there are some patterns that remain the same.
""It's funny, the nature of the relationships I see on 'Catfish' are all very specific. It's people who, for the most part, met as friends. Once in a while, it will start in a dating app, but usually it's unsuspecting,"" he explained. ""You're online, you get a 'friend request' from someone you don't really know, but you have some mutual friends so you say 'sure.' Then they start acting very friendly and you become enamored by them and flirtation leads to the next thing and before you know it, you're in a relationship.""
Schulman stops short of equating getting catfished exclusively with online dating because he's seen these deep  ""relationships"" develop out of friendship or an innocuous non-romantic conversation countless times. However, when it comes to ways to avoid getting catfished in 2019, the host says the basics haven't changed.
""Obviously you can get lied to or have a bad date. But the trouble is when you invest too much of yourself into a relationship that you haven't met,"" he explained. ""I would say the trend, or if people are going to online date, just know that if you're talking to someone for maybe, I don't know, a couple weeks, barring any strange circumstances like travel or work and they can't meet up with you... Something is probably off, and that's what you have to look out for.""
Schulman hosts a new crop of episodes debuting in June on MTV. Although he's going without his longtime co-host Max Joseph, who left the show in 2018, he's excited to get back out there and help some people.
""I am excited about this season of 'Catfish' for a lot of reasons. We went to some wild new places, we had things that have never happened happen to us and I have a bunch of really great co-hosts this season. Some you've seen before, some you haven't, who just bring incredible fresh energy to the show and we had a lot of fun. So, I think I want people to watch the show because there's a lot of TV you can watch that might not change the way you think about yourself, but our show pushes people to change the way they talk about one another in many ways.""

45386275,424545,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,University of Western Australia,ORGANIZATION,86407,3,1,"Once upon a time, Western Australia was covered in forests and those forests were filled with sightless, eyeless, tip-tapping critters called schizomids. But over the course of the last 66 million years, the region grew much hotter and drier as the whole continent shifted north toward the equator. Those forests slowly died, and the creatures within them had to find new homes. So they fled underground in many waves, evolving to survive in their radically changed environments.
That's the story told in a new paper based on a genetic study of those strange arachnids. The critters, very distant cousins of spiders and scorpions, are found all over the world. But only in Western Australia's Pilbara region do they turn up underground. The researchers describe 56 newfound species in their study, an incredibly diverse group for such a small area.
""We think there are likely to be a lot more species out there, because they have such small distributions ... and we've only been able to sample a few places,"" lead researcher Kym Abrams, a biologist at The University of Western Australia, said in a statement. [Goliath Birdeater: Images of a Colossal Spider]
Usually, when researchers run across previously unknown subterranean schizomids, she said, it's during an environmental survey of the sort typically conducted before major construction projects.
That diversity of these species, Abrams and her team wrote in the paper, likely resulted from how splintered the species became as the region dried out. Eyeless schizomids are blind, and so they use their long forelegs to tap around their environments, almost like someone using a cane. And individual species all over the world tend to occupy relatively small areas.
But as Australia's dried-out west forced these Pilbara critters underground, the arachnids appear to have become even more isolated from one another, separated by long stretches of cooked land. And once isolated, each cluster of schizomids was free to evolve along its own path, a bit like if they'd each been dropped on different Pacific islands.
Biologists had long wondered, the team wrote, whether Australian subterranean schizomids had all descended from a single species that traveled below the surface all at once, or whether the creatures dropped into the dirty depths in waves. This research, the scientists wrote, suggests that even though all 56 species behave similarly -- all but one type live their entire lives underground, never emerging to the surface where their ancestors lived -- they're descended from different waves of subterranean pioneers.
Once underground, the descendants of those pioneers got further separated from one another, evolving separately into an even wider variety of species.
This research was published online as part of the upcoming October issue of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security.

In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security.

And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.
The American public deserves and should demand more from its public servants.  Unfortunately, true public servants at the highest level of government seem to be a thing of the past. Until the DHS swamp is drained, we are going to be hard-pressed to realize true border security.

45041963,423294,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,DHS,ORGANIZATION,3480,15,3,"At least 10 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States and the number is growing daily.
In an effort to address this issue, fulfill its congressionally mandated duties, and restore integrity to the immigration system, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent the last few months developing a detailed operation meant to locate, apprehend, and deport illegal immigrants who have been lawfully ordered deported by an immigration judge but refused to leave the country in further defiance of our laws.
Unlike what has been widely reported in the mainstream media, the operation was not targeting persons who had not exhausted all of their lengthy appeals processes and received a final order of deportation.  Instead, the operation was humane, it comported with the rule of law and due process, and was similar to an operation carried out by ICE in 2015 under the Obama administration which flew under the radar.
In short, this operation was exactly what both Democratic and Republican lawmakers envisioned when they enacted our immigration laws. It was a common sense law enforcement operation and approach to an ever-growing problem......but consider this operation now trashed!
As recently reported in the Washington Examiner, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan allegedly disclosed the scope, date, and location - law enforcement sensitive information - to the Washington Post just prior to the operation's start date.
If this is true, then Mr. McAleenan was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm's way in order to further his own agenda, an agenda which has not aligned with that of President Trump from the day he was appointed to his previous position as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Before the ""why"" question can be answered, you must know who Mr. McAleenan really is.
Mr. McAleenan's personal beliefs are rooted in liberal policy and philosophy. Not a negative or positive quality, except when you consider he has been charged with carrying out President Trump's immigration agenda.  He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions.
According to Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. McAleenan was an outspoken proponent of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Also, prior to 2010, Mr. McAleenan donated large sums of money (comparatively speaking for a federal employee) to both the Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates.  According to the FEC records I've seen, he has never donated to the Republican Party or a Republican candidate.
Again, I will not hold a person's political leanings against them unless it interferes with job performance or endangers the safety of the general public and the law enforcement officers over whom he has charge. In fact, I consider a number of Democratic politicians my friends. But political affiliation or leanings don't tell the whole story. Mr. McAleenan's bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps.
At first glance, Mr. McAleenan's bio as CBP Commissioner looks very impressive. But upon close inspection, you will notice it's long on titles and job functions but very short on border security accomplishments.
In fact, and especially as it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure. Notwithstanding the fact that he was handed the gift of apprehension numbers that were at a 45-year low in April of 2015, Mr. McAleenan failed to implement any policies or operations that would have assisted CBP in keeping the numbers low. Instead, Mr. McAleenan is responsible for the largest immigration crisis the United States has ever seen. His job performance has been completely unacceptable.
Now that we know who he is, we can attempt to answer ""why"" he would stymie an ICE operation that had the potential to do so much good. By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.
His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump's expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program.  And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk.

The comments from State Rep. Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.
""Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,"" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. ""We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.""
The lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.
""Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,"" she said.
According to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he ""wasn't going to turn them in"" himself.
""I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,"" she told police, according to Fox 13.
But the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: ""So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?""
Police then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.
An arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.
Irby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.
""Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,"" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. ""In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.""
Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to ""safeguard every citizen's rights.
""When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,"" he said.

Lopez is never shy about sharing his distaste for Trump, having previously gotten into a fight at a Hooters with a Trump supporter, slammed his alleged $50,000 golf simulator at the White House and pretended to urinate on the president's Walk of Fame star. However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.
Lopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as ""anchor baby"" and the mothers as ""immigrant.""
""Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,"" Lopez captioned the meme.
""Anchor baby"" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Trump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.
In addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.
The post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.
""Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!"" Lopez shot back.

For eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. With the United States needing a tougher posture against Iran and confronting renewed challenges in Asia and Europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure America has the carriers it needs.
The requirement to maintain carrier presence in the Middle East is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which U.S. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.
Indeed, the Navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the Cold War, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.
During the Obama administration, a ""rebalance"" supposedly allowed the Pentagon to focus on Asia and Europe while washing its hands of the Middle East. In reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the Asia-Pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the Middle East.
Now with a growing Iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.
This also places Tehran's proxies on the borders of key U.S. allies. Beginning next year, Tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as U.N. arms embargoes expire. It is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent Tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.
Credible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for American policymakers.
Last month's intelligence suggesting Iran was ready to move against U.S. interests in the Middle East demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden Iran. Responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group into the region has dramatically increased the U.S. force posture. Effective deterrence of Iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.
A combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.
Most fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in U.S. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission late last year.
At minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. The decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman two decades early.
But only sustained political will from both the administration and Congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the ""Navy the Nation Needs.""
Working with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.
These changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.
In the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.
Currently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.
The will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.

Working with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.
These changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.
In the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.
Currently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.
The will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.

But only sustained political will from both the administration and Congress can provide steady, predictable funding to enable the most cost-effective and efficient procurement and maintenance of the ""Navy the Nation Needs.""
Working with the Navy, legislators should expedite the pace of carrier procurement from one every five years to every three or four. Even with these forward-thinking decisions, given the current maintenance requirements and long construction times, the Navy will still face a carrier shortfall for several years.
These changes would help address shortcomings in America's defense posture for future administrations, and not just against Iran. But they would not be felt for some time, while Tehran is already lashing out.
In the shorter term, the United States could send forward-deploying missile defense ships and other surface combatants to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific.
Currently, several minesweepers and patrol craft are the only homeported Navy ships between Spain and Japan; while very useful against Iran, alone they offer little deterrence. Coordination with and support for regional allies is critical too, including stronger multilateral maritime security and missile defense efforts.
The will to prepare is as important as the will to win, yet for too long the United States has neglected a focused and disciplined approach to properly resourcing the U.S. Navy's fleet. The result was a painfully obvious gap in our deterrent capability in the Middle East for far too long last year, and it could well happen again.
American policymakers urgently must begin implementing quick and big fixes alike to restore readiness to our fleet in general and our carrier fleet in particular. The U.S. Navy must be able to handle a significant range of threats worldwide and to do so, it must grow both in size and capability.

45152259,423613,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,U.S. Navy,ORGANIZATION,30582,20,2,"The recent oil tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman reinforce the need to reestablish a highly visible U.S. naval deterrent in the Middle East.
For eight months last year, no aircraft carrier strike group plied the region, the longest such interruption this millennium. With the United States needing a tougher posture against Iran and confronting renewed challenges in Asia and Europe, several immediate measures and concerted longer-term efforts are critical to ensure America has the carriers it needs.
The requirement to maintain carrier presence in the Middle East is a critical part of a larger national security strategy, in which U.S. global security interests necessitate a worldwide force presence.
Indeed, the Navy's mission demands remain as high as those of the Cold War, calling on ships to be everywhere seemingly at once, but today's fleet is less than half the size it was 30 years ago.
During the Obama administration, a ""rebalance"" supposedly allowed the Pentagon to focus on Asia and Europe while washing its hands of the Middle East. In reality, we never effectively rebalanced forces in the Asia-Pacific, and the situation on the ground forced us to remain deeply involved in the Middle East.
Now with a growing Iranian threat, it would be imprudent to suddenly abandon the region, even as we face renewed challenges in the Pacific, Atlantic and Mediterranean.
This also places Tehran's proxies on the borders of key U.S. allies. Beginning next year, Tehran can start upgrading its conventional and missile arsenals as U.N. arms embargoes expire. It is also threatening to resume progress toward nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration is pursuing robust sanctions, but these alone are likely insufficient to prevent Tehran's aggression and reassure our regional allies.
Credible forward-deployed military capability -- like a carrier strike group -- provides real options for American policymakers.
Last month's intelligence suggesting Iran was ready to move against U.S. interests in the Middle East demonstrates how the absence of such forces could embolden Iran. Responding to this intelligence, the prompt movement of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group into the region has dramatically increased the U.S. force posture. Effective deterrence of Iran will require persistent, visible and credible military capability.
A combination of far-reaching and short-term policy changes can address this challenge.
Most fundamentally, systemic shortcomings in U.S. defense spending and readiness undermine our deterrence and increase risks of military conflict, as underscored by the non-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission late last year.
At minimum, 12 aircraft carriers are needed for there to be three forward-deployed at any given time. The decision to procure two carriers is a good start in attacking the shortfall, as is reversing the questionable budget proposal to retire the USS Harry S. Truman two decades early.

Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. 
In recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.
At the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.

44983455,423137,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Army,ORGANIZATION,1,13,2,"The U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as President Trump nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone, officials confirmed to Fox News. 
Sources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.
Fox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. 
Yahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. 
""I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" he tweeted at the time.
Yet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. 
""Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,"" John Bolton said. ""No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East."" 
With the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. 
For its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. 
Amid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.
The drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran.

44982843,423136,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Fox News,ORGANIZATION,1860,10,1,"An amusement park in India has been shut down after 12 people reportedly sustained injuries due to a mechanical malfunction that caused a ride to plummet 10 feet to the ground.
The Free Fall ride at Queensland Amusement Park in Chennai, was ordered to suspend operations ""indefinitely"" - along with the rest of the theme park - following an incident last week that left at least 12 people injured, according to local outlets.
According to The News Minute, the accident comes two months after officials sent a notice to the park about its equipment.
""We wrote to them in April to ensure that all the rides were in good shape. They claimed that they had checked everything but clearly that was not the case,"" assistant commissioner Muthuvel Pandi said.
In video of the fall, the riders are seen on two platforms being hoisted into the air. However, once the ride finishes and the platforms are lowered back to the ground, the steel cables holding one of the platforms snaps and those strapped to it crash to the ground.
The extent of the riders' injuries was not reported.
According to police, they did not find out of the incident until the footage went viral on social media, noting no one from the park came forward to file a complaint.
""We came to know after the video of the accident reached us. The amusement park tried to hide the whole thing and we believe they convinced the visitors who were in the ride to strike a compromise. All first aid was done there without any external interference,"" Pandi told the outlet.
Police contacted the park with a notice demanding the theme park shut down until they obtained legal documents to prove each of the rides are in safe workings order.
Fox News contacted Queensland Amusement Park for comment.

The tool, which was produced by researchers from the USC Information Sciences Institute, can detect subtle face and head movements along with unique artifacts in video files, and apparently can identify such fakes with up to 96 percent accuracy.
Deepfakes, even amateurish ones like the widely circulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that was slowed down to make her appear drunk or senile, have become a growing concern and prompted a backlash against Big Tech for not doing enough to crack down on them.
Most deepfake detection models look at videos on a frame-by-frame basis to determine if they've been manipulated. However, the USC researchers review an entire video all at once and examine potential inconsistencies in how the subject in the footage moves -- which the researchers refer to as ""softbiometric signatures"" in their published work.
""To contend with this growing threat, we describe a forensic technique that models facial expressions and movements that typify an individual's speaking pattern. Although not visually apparent, these correlations are often violated by the nature of how deep-fake videos are created and can, therefore, be used for authentication,"" the researchers write in the study's abstract.
The scientists used a data set of about 1,000 manipulated videos to train its tool, which became adept at figuring out deepfakes of leading politicians and celebrities.
The issue of what do about deepfakes won't be going away anytime soon. Scientists last week revealed a software tool that literally allows you to put words into someone else's mouth.

In a memo sent to the White House, the committee said it ""will hold a hearing to examine the recommendation of the independent Office of Special Counsel (OSC) that President Trump remove Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway from federal service, as well as reports by OSC about Ms. Conway and other Trump Administration appointees."" The memo continued: ""The Committee also will hold a business meeting to consider a subpoena in the event that Ms. Conway does not appear.""
The OSC recommended earlier in June that Conway be fired from the federal government for violating the Hatch Act on ""numerous occasions"" through TV interviews and on Twitter. The Hatch Act is a federal law that limits certain political activities of federal employees.
Speaking on ""Fox & Friends,"" Conway said that, according to White House counsel, it is unclear legally whether the Hatch Act ""applies to assistants to the president.""
""We think I would be the first member of the West Wing to ever be hauled in front of Congress to talk about the Hatch Act,"" she said, questioning whether her TV appearances and social media activity would fall under the Hatch Act.
""You know what they're mad about? They want to put a big roll of masking tape over my mouth. I helped as the campaign manager for the successful part of the campaign,"" she argued.
""I helped by being on television, by being on radio. I helped and they want to silence me. Now, this is my First Amendment right. They want to chill free speech because they don't know how to beat him at the ballot box. They were hoping that the other Office of Special Counsel would do the job. Even if the Hatch Act applies, our position is I haven't violated it.""

Mark Wells, who played forward on the gold medal team that upset the Soviet Union on their way to the matchup against Finland to win the medal, gave the stick to the St. Clair Shores Civic Arena in Michigan in 1980 - the last time it was seen.
St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby announced last Monday that Wells' stick had been returned to the arena, according to the Macomb Daily. He declined to give details but said Wells was happy that stick was back in the arena - where he had intended to be 39 years ago.

Each team member received a stick autographed by the players and coach Herb Brooks. Similar sticks have sold for $290,000 in recent years, according to the Macomb Daily.
The stick is being protected by the St. Clair Shores Police Department for the time being.

45035613,423290,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Customs Enforcement,ORGANIZATION,9595,1,1,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to ""stand down"" on the operation.
A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

45035634,423290,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,DHS,ORGANIZATION,410,3,1,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to ""stand down"" on the operation.
A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.

""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

45035707,423290,english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser,Congress,ORGANIZATION,387,17,1,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to ""stand down"" on the operation.
A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""
The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.
""He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,"" the source told Fox News. ""He has been fighting this operation since its inception.""
On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.
Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.
""You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,"" Homan said. ""He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.""
He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""
The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.
""To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,"" the source told Fox News, noting that ""you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.""
Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.
Representatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.
Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that ""due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.""
ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants ""who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.""
By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.
The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would ""begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""
On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would ""give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.""
He added: ""I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.""

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted out a photo on Sunday with the caption ""Occupy Mars"" - the only problem being the picture wasn't of the Red Planet after all. The picture was actually of the Moon during the July 2018 lunar eclipse that bathed the celestial body in a red hue.
Users were quick to point out Musk's error.
""Hey Super Space Genius, that's the moon in a total lunar eclipse,"" wrote Australian scientist Upulie Divisekera.
""The hero who is going to colonize Mars doesn't know what Mars looks like. Fantastic!"" joked one user.
Musk responded to the correction, writing, they'd travel to the ""moon too,"" before telling another user, ""For sure moon 1st, as it's only 3 days away & u don't need interplanetary orbital synchronization.""
The CEO had posted the graphic after tweeting SpaceX was ""Accelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy.""
SpaceX has been developing a means of interplanetary travel with its ""Starship"" spacecraft - a reusable 9.7 million-pound rocket that measures 387 feet. Musk plans to use the rocket to take citizens to Mars - or maybe the Moon first.

The first debate of the Democratic primary season will be split into two nights, given the size of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.
Documentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel ""candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night"" but he disagrees because ""news cycle lasts more than a day"" and Trump could do something himself to distract.
The MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
""I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*"" Hayes tweeted.
Avirgan fired back, ""I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.""
Hayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.
It's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.
Hayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.
""If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,"" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.
But the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.
""@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,"" the memorial tweeted.
