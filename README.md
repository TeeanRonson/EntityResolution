# EntityResolution
Building a Model for Entity Resolution of People, Places, and Organisations

### What is ER?
Entity Resolution refers to the task of finding all mentions of same -real world entity within a knowledge base or across multiple knowledge bases. This can be achieved through linking and grouping.For example, there could be different ways of addressing the same person in text, different addresses for businesses, or photos of a particular object.

The goal of ER is to "resolve" entities, by identifying the records that represent the same entity and reconciling them to obtain one record per entity.

### ER Motivation 
In the modern world, the speed and volume of data has increased exponentially. Thus making inference across networks and semantic relationships between entities a greater challenge to overcome. Entity resolution can reduce the complexity by proposing canonicalised references to entities and deduplicating and linking entities.


### ER Tasks 
- Deduplication: The process of clustering/grouping records or mentions that represent the same real world entity.
- Record Linkage: The process of matching records from one deduplicated knowledge base to another.
- Canonicalisation:Â The process of converting data with more than one possible representation into a standard form.
- Reference Matching: The process of matching noisy records to clean ones in a deduplicated reference table.
