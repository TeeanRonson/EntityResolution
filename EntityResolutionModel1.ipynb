    "# Entity Resolution with Dedupe.io\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe is a library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe will help us remove duplicate entries from our people dataset of name entities, whilst taking into account the paragraph information which provides context to the named entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe takes in human training data and comes up with the best rules for your dataset to quickly and automatically find similar records, even with very large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Types\n",
    "A variable definition describes the records that you want to match. It is a dictionary where the keys are the fields and the values are the field specification. For our example, we will use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String Types\n",
    "String types are compared using affine gap string distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Types\n",
    "Fields containing long blocks of text e.g. product descriptions or article abstracts we use the Text type fields. These are compared using the cosine similarity metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a measurement of the amount of words that two documents have in common. This measure can be made more useful as the overlap of rare words counts more than the overlap of common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If provided a sequence of example fields (i.e. a corpus) then dedupe will learn these weights for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name Types\n",
    "A Name variable should be used for a field that contains American names, corporations and households. It uses the probablepeople package to split apart a name string into components like give name, surname, generational suffix, for people names, and abbreviation, company type, and legal form for corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose column types --> Train Model --> Review Clusters --> Add to clusters --> Polish Clusters"

    "## Building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Record similarity\n",
    "We make the assumpiton that records that are more similar are more likely to be duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default way that this is done in Dedupe is to use what’s called a string metric. A string metric is a way of taking two strings and returning a number that is low if the strings are similar and high if they are dissimilar. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different string metrics, and we actually use a metric called the Affine Gap Distance. It counts the number of substitutions that must be made to turn one string into another. It is similar to our familiar Levenshtein distance, that is used in Fuzzy Wuzzy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularized logistic regression\n",
    "If we supply pairs of records that we label as either being duplicates or distinct, then Dedupe will learn a set of weights such that the record distance can easily be transformed into our best estimate of the probability that a pair of records are duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have learned these good weights, we want to use them to find which records are duplicates. But turns out that doing this the naive way will usually not work, and we’ll have to do something smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active Learning\n",
    "In order to learn those weights, Dedupe needs example pairs with labels. Most of the time, we will need to supply those labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the whole point of Dedupe is to save people’s time, and that includes making good use of labeling time so we use an approach called Active Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we maintain a set of the pairs where there is disagreement: that is pairs which classifier believes are duplicates but which are not covered by the current blocking rules, and the pairs which the classifier believes are distinct but which are blocked together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dedupe picks, at random from this disagreement set, a pair of records and asks the user to decide. Once it gets this label, it relearns the weights and blocking rules. We then recalculate the disagreement set.\n",

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream.

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n</td>\n",

The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n\n",

But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls.

We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.\"\\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.</td>\n",

I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.\"\\nThe \"Hardball\" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died \"weren't the bad guys.\"\\n\"The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,\" Matthews elaborated.\\n\"We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.\"\\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.

       "      <td>A former University of Illinois doctoral student was convicted Monday of killing a visiting scholar from China after abducting her at a bus stop as she headed to sign an off-campus apartment lease.\\nJurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.\\nThe swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.\\nProsecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.\\nJurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.\\nThere are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.\\nZhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>A top Facebook executive said there's no evidence that Russia influenced the Brexit referendum result, prompting a backlash from some British lawmakers and critics of the tech giant.\\nNick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who currently serves as the social network's head of global policy and communications, said the company's internal investigations did not find proof that misuse of the social network impacted the Brexit vote -- unlike when the company conducted a similar inquiry for the U.S. presidential election.\\n\"We ran two full analyses of all the data we have in the run-up to the Brexit referendum, following exactly the same methodology as we did after the FBI notified Facebook of outside interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\" Clegg told BBC News on Monday. \"We've shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.\"\\nClegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created \"the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\"\\nCarole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.\\n\"So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,\" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.\\nA Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the \"lavish lifestyle\" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.\\nDavid Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.\\n\"Horse manure,\" Lammy wrote on Twitter. \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?\"\\nCollins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.\\nFacebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>A former University of Illinois doctoral student was convicted Monday of killing a visiting scholar from China after abducting her at a bus stop as she headed to sign an off-campus apartment lease.\\nJurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.\\nThe swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.\\nProsecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.\\nJurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.\\nThere are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.\\nZhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n</td>\n",

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as President Trump nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone, officials confirmed to Fox News. \\nSources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.\\nFox News has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. \\nYahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. \\n\"I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,\" he tweeted at the time.\\nYet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. \\n\"Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,\" John Bolton said. \"No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East.\" \\nWith the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. \\nFor its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. \\nAmid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.\\nThe drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. \\nIn recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.\\nAt the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.\\nWarships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets. \\n</td>\n",

Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.\\nMore than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.\\nRebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.\\nMutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.\\n\"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,\" he said.\\n\"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,\" he said. \"I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.\"\\nThe idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.\\n\"We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,\" Redfield said.\\nMutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.\\nThe new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala. They talk about recognizing the early signs of Ebola, early treatment and prevention measures.\\n</td>\n",

We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.\"\\nClegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created \"the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\"\\nCarole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.\\n\"So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,\" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.\\nA Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the \"lavish lifestyle\" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.\\nDavid Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.\\n\"Horse manure,\" Lammy wrote on Twitter. \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?\"\\nCollins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.\\nFacebook had no further comment when contacted by Fox News on Monday.\\n</td>\n",

However, the former foreign secretary and London mayor has spoken to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, defending his Brexit plans and decision not to speak about the widely reported row between himself and his partner Carrie Symonds.\\nHe said he did not believe \"for a moment\" that the UK would leave the EU without a deal, although he was willing for it to happen if necessary. Mr Johnson also said the EU would have to co-operate to avoid a hard Irish border.\\nOn his personal life, he refused to describe what had happened with Ms Symonds in the early hours of last Friday, saying: \"I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones.\"\\nThe BBC looks at Mr Johnson's track record in politics and that of fellow leadership contender Jeremy Hunt.\\nPlus, find out more about the Tory members choosing between them.\\nThe latest royal accounts show that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home - Frogmore Cottage in Windsor - was renovated with PS2.4m of taxpayers' money. The couple paid for fittings at the property, which was converted from five separate homes. Meanwhile, the Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was PS82m in 2018-19.

Her parents, Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who have campaigned for changes to the law, said they were \"delighted\". \"Natasha's Law\" is set to come into force in England and Northern Ireland by summer 2021.\\nThe BBC looks at the effects of severe allergic reactions,\\nIn the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.\\nThere are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?\\nHer suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions?

However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.\\nLopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as \"anchor baby\" and the mothers as \"immigrant.\"\\n\"Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,\" Lopez captioned the meme.\\n\"Anchor baby\" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\\nTrump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.\\nIn addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.\\nThe post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.\\n\"Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!\" Lopez shot back.\\n</td>\n",

He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey \"regrettable on many levels.\"\\n\"I think frustrations were high,\" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. \"And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.\"\\nCallaway repeatedly called Healey a \"motherf---er\" after the reporter told the manager that he would \"see you tomorrow\" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would \"knock you the f--- out, bro\" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.\\nIn a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.\\n\"He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,\" Healey told the paper. \"I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.\"\\nThe Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: \"The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.\"\\n\"I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,\" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, \"and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.\"\\nCallaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: \"I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.\"\\nHowever, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.\\n\"I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,\" Callaway said. \"It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.\"\\nVargas said Monday that the issue was \"an unfortunate distraction.\"\\n\"Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,\" Vargas told reporters. \"So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.\"\\nThe Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves.

Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.\\nMore than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.\\nRebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.\\nMutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.\\n\"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,\" he said.\\n\"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,\" he said. \"I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.\"\\nThe idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.\\n\"We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,\" Redfield said.\\nMutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.\\nThe new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala.

       "      <td>A former University of Illinois doctoral student was convicted Monday of killing a visiting scholar from China after abducting her at a bus stop as she headed to sign an off-campus apartment lease.\\nJurors deliberated less than 90 minutes at the federal death-penalty trial in Peoria, Ill.\\nThe swift conviction was expected because Brendt Christensen's attorneys acknowledged from the start that he raped and stabbed Yingying Zhang in June 2017.\\nProsecutors said he beat her to death with a baseball bat and decapitated her.\\nJurors found Christensen guilty of kidnapping resulting in death, which carries a possible death sentence. Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah.

Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called \"remain in Mexico\" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.\\nNuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.\\nPrevious rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.\\n\"It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,\" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. \"The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion).

       "      <td>Everyone knew weeks ago that the New Orleans Pelicans would claim Duke star Zion Williamson with the first pick in the NBA Draft.\\nIf only we could enjoy such lucidity on Capitol Hill.\\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and others ventured to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week with the goal of establishing annual spending figures for the next two years, avoiding government shutdowns and raising the debt ceiling.\\n\"We're close,\" observed Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as he exited the conclave. By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: \"I think we're further apart.\"\\nThe varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.\\nJust before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.\\n\"We're going to get it done,\" said the source, who asked not to be identified. \"We have to.\"\\nThe big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.\\n\"You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\\nCongressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.\\n\"Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,\" McConnell said last month.\\nThen came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.\\nEverything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a \"cover-up\" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.\\nGranted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing \"Kumbaya\" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.\\nSo, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.\\n\"In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,\" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. \"Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.\"\\nStanding next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.\\nPelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.\\n\"When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,\" Pelosi said.\\nThe Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.\\n\"Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?\" retorted an agitated Pelosi. \"Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.\"\\nThat conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.\\nMulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.\\n\"I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.\\nOne senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney \"p---ed everybody off\" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.\\nHowever, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.\\nAfter the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.\\n\"Everybody is trying to raise the caps,\" said Mulvaney.\\nAfter the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.\\n\"So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,\" said Mulvaney.\\nThe Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House \"deemed\" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.\\nHoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" or \"OCO.\" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.\\n\"That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,\" said Hoyer. \"[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.\"\\nThe lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.\\nWhen asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied \"as long as we can get. As early as we can get.\"\\nBut the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as \"messaging\" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.\\nOne source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.\\nRepublicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.\\nThe downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.\\nSo this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Trump on Monday unveiled a new online fundraising site to give his re-election campaign and other Republicans running in 2020 a new platform to compete with the Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations.\\n\"I am pleased to announce the launch of tmagac.winred.com,\" the president announced Monday on Twitter. \"This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!\"\\nThe new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.\\nWhile the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.\\nThat advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.\\nThe launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.\\nWinRed is part of \"The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,\" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's \"a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').\"\\nThe president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.\\nA Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>SAN DIEGO- An expert witness called by the prosecution in the court-martial trial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher told the court Monday that there is no physical or photographic evidence to prove a stabbing occurred in the death of an ISIS prisoner back in 2017. \\nDr. Frank Sheridan, a forensic pathologist, told a Navy prosecutor earlier that the alleged victim's injuries were consistent with a stab wound, but later-- when questioned by Gallagher's attorney-- appeared to cast doubt on his earlier comments.\\n\"There is no evidence at all that a stabbing occurred,\" said Maj. Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \\n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \\nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to \"stand down\" on the operation.\\nA source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the \"Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.\"\\nThe source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\\n\"He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told Fox News. \"He has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\\nOn Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.\\nTom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.\\n\"You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,\" Homan said. \"He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.\"\\nHe noted that the leaked story \"gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets\" and added: \"This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\\nThe source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\\n\"To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,\" the source told Fox News, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.\"\\nSources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.\\nRepresentatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.\\nFollowing the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that \"due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\"\\nICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants \"who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.\"\\nBy Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.\\nThe change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would \"begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\"\\nOn Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would \"give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.\"\\nHe added: \"I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.\"\\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \\n</td>\n",

His report a year ago was very good,\" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.\\n\"Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.\"\\nAs part of its ongoing \"multifaceted\" and \"broad\" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several \"non-governmental organizations and individuals.\"\\nAdditionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, led by Durham, was looking into the involvement of \"foreign intelligence services.\"\\nFormer Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely \"CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel\" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to \"seduce him\" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.\\nThe information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.\\nThe letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.\\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.\\n</td>\n",

And, to also draw a contrast with each other,\" Brazile said.\\nClimate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or \"green\" plan to tackle the issue.\\nHowever, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.\\nIn May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.\\nOn Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.\\nThat's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.\\nThe Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.\\n\"Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,\" Sanders said. \"The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.\"\\nRep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.\\nAn impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: \"What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.\"\\n\"It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,\" the New Yorker said.\\nOn \"America's Newsroom,\" Brazile said Americans \"want to hear solutions\" to the issue.\"45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,\" Brazile noted.\\n\"There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions.\"\\n</td>\n",

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians.

Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control.

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.\"\\n

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.\"\\n

We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.\"\\nClegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created \"the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\"\\nCarole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.\\n\"So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,\" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.\\nA Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the \"lavish lifestyle\" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.\\nDavid Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.\\n\"Horse manure,\" Lammy wrote on Twitter. \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?\"\\nCollins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.\\nFacebook

Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\\nConnecticut federal prosecutor John Durham is looking closely at the intelligence community's activity in late 2016 and early 2017, the House Freedom Caucus chairman claimed on \"Hannity.\"\\n\"I can tell you that John Durham and Attorney General Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,\" he said.\\n\"They are including in part of their surveillance - really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.\"\\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who joined Meadows on \"Hannity,\" added he agreed with the North Carolina lawmaker and that a previous report by the Justice Department's inspector general was fruitful.\\n\"The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation,\" he said. \"They have told us this is broader than just the FBI - they're going to look at all of this.\\n\"First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,\" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.\\n\"Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.\"\\nAs part of its ongoing \"multifaceted\" and \"broad\" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several \"non-governmental organizations and individuals.\"\\nAdditionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, led by Durham, was looking into the involvement of \"foreign intelligence services.\"\\nFormer Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely \"CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel\" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to \"seduce him\" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.\\nThe information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.\\nThe letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.\\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.\\n

He added that \"they had pre-existing health issues.\"\\nSanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.\\n\"Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,\" he said. \"Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.\"\\nIn a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \\nEdward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.\\nSeveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\\nAutopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\\nFBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\\nThe news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\\nMany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.\\nThe FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.\\nAmong the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\\nAs Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.\\nDominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\\nIn the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.\\nSuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\\nSuero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\\nAt the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.\\n\"It's a mystery,\" Bullock told WTOP. \"There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\\nBullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\\n\"We need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.\\nSanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\\nAllen's family has disputed those conclusions.\\nThe health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.\\nHer son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her.

Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.\\nThere are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.\\nZhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n

He added that \"they had pre-existing health issues.\"\\nSanchez Cardenas said the bottom line was that there was nothing nefarious about the rash of the U.S. tourist deaths dogging the country since first making headlines in the spring.\\n\"Each one of these involved pre-existing health issues leading up to their deaths,\" he said. \"Every one of these cases can be explained. The autopsies show what happened.\"\\nIn a text message sent to Fox News, Steven Bullock, the attorney representing the Maryland couple's families, called the public health minister's remarks about the two tourists \"absolutely ludicrous.\" \\nEdward Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Day, 49, who were engaged, were found unresponsive in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana by a resort employee who went to check on them after they failed to check out. The couple, who had been at the resort since May 25, had plans to return to the United States the day they turned up dead.\\nSeveral medications were found in the room, including an anti-inflammatory drug, an opioid and blood-pressure medicine, Dominican officials said at a news conference last Friday. Autopsies for many of the tourists showed pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs frequently triggered by heart disease. Among nearly a dozen U.S. tourists who have died in the country in the last 18 months, Dominican investigators said most died of a heart attack.\\nAutopsies for Day and Holmes showed they had enlarged hearts, internal bleeding and pulmonary edema. Day was said to have fluid in the brain. On the radio show, the health minister said that Holmes was \"morbidly obese.\"\\nFBI officials have been conducting toxicological tests in their Virginia research center on blood samples from the couple, as well as from a Pennsylvania woman, Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died at the same resort complex five days before. Schaup-Werner's relatives said she collapsed after she had a drink from the minibar. Her autopsy stated she had a heart attack.\\nThe news of Holmes' and Day's deaths, made public by their families when they went to the media with concerns about investigators' preliminary determination that the two died of natural causes, prompted friends and relatives of other U.S. tourists who died in other Dominican resorts to come forward, sharing their suspicions and bewilderment about what killed their loved ones.\\nMany of the families described their deceased relatives as having been in generally good health right before traveling to the Dominican Republic. They have expressed outrage over what they saw as a concerted effort by Dominican officials to pin the deaths on the people who died. Some families have been arranging for their own autopsies and toxicological tests in the U.S.\\nThe FBI told Fox News last week that the bureau sent a team to the Dominican Republic to help investigate the deaths.\\nAmong the questions that relatives and some U.S. public health and epidemiological experts have raised: whether at least some of the deaths might have been caused by counterfeit alcohol or by pesticides or insect-killer chemicals that somehow wound up on drinking glasses or utensils.\\nAs Sanchez Cardenas was wrapping up the radio interview Monday morning, friends and family of Cynthia Day were gathering at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden in Maryland for her memorial service. Holmes' funeral has been scheduled for Wednesday.\\nDominican officials often have emphasized the presence of several prescription medications in the room where Day and Holmes were staying, but only in the last week started saying outright that the meds seemed to have played a role in their deaths.\\nIn the morning radio interview, Sanchez Cardenas said the couple had a practical \"pharmacy\" in their room. Last week, Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, told Fox News in a wide-ranging phone interview that the coverage of the rash of deaths in the popular Caribbean vacation spot as \"mysterious\" was nothing but fake news. Suero said that in a competitive industry such as tourism, there were people who would try to undermine a top destination such as the Dominican Republic.\\nSuero laid out many of the arguments and scenarios that Sanchez Cardenas underscored in the radio interview, speaking about the health issues that some of the tourists allegedly had, and saying that perhaps it wasn't responsible to travel with such health problems.\\nSuero told Fox News that Holmes died first and Cox died afterward, saying that the shock of seeing Holmes dead next to her could have killed her.\\nAt the funeral service, Bullock told reporters he did not buy the account by Dominican investigators about the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Day and Holmes.\\n\"It's a mystery,\" Bullock told WTOP. \"There's reason for us to pause, and we're going to investigate this and get this matter resolved.\"\\nBullock said he was focused on getting more information from U.S. officials and results of toxicology tests before jumping to conclusions.\\n\"We need to find out what's going on and what happened,\" said Meshonn Madison, Day's friend.\\nSanchez Cardenas also singled out the deaths of Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of New York. He said Allen had unhealthful habits such as smoking and drinking regularly, and a report on his death referred to him as \"a ticking timebomb,\" adding that \"his organs were practically destroyed, with a biological age of more than 80 years old. He was extremely obese, weighing more than 400 pounds.\"\\nAllen's family has disputed those conclusions.\\nThe health minister said Cox's autopsy showed she previously had suffered several heart attacks. However, her family and her former supervisor at the New York hospital where she worked as an MRI technician said Cox had never suffered a heart attack.\\nHer son, Will Cox, lashed out at Dominican investigators as untrustworthy and said they repeated had put up roadblocks when he tried to get answers and that they tried to rush him into letting them cremate or embalm her. With the intervention of the U.S. Embassy and congressional lawmakers, Cox succeeded in getting Dominican officials to agree to send a vial of his mother's blood to the U.S., where the hospital where she worked would run toxicology tests.\\n\"We're not talking about a patient who had no medical conditions,\" the health minister said of Leyla Cox in the radio interview. \"A person with hypertension is vulnerable to a heart attack.\"\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

You may even disagree with him on that.\"\\nThe comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.\\n\"'The FBI has no leadership,'\" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. \"'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.' (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch.\"\\nWhen asked earlier this year if he believed the Trump campaign was spied on in 2016, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee: \"That's not the term I would use.\\n\"Lots of people have different colloquial phrases.

You may even disagree with him on that.\"\\nThe comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.\\n\"'The FBI has no leadership,'\" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. \"'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.' (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch.\"\\nWhen asked earlier this year if he believed the Trump campaign was spied on in 2016, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee: \"That's not the term I would use.\\n\"Lots of people have different colloquial phrases. I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me the key question is making sure

You may even disagree with him on that.\"\\nThe comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.\\n\"'The FBI has no leadership,'\" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. \"'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.' (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch.\"\\nWhen asked earlier this year if he believed the Trump campaign was spied on in 2016, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee: \"That's not the term I would use.\\n\"Lots of people have different colloquial phrases. I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me the key question is making sure

You may even disagree with him on that.\"\\nThe comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.\\n\"'The FBI has no leadership,'\" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. \"'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.' (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch.\"\\nWhen asked earlier this year if he believed the Trump campaign was spied on in 2016, Wray told lawmakers on the Senate Appropriations Committee: \"That's not the term I would use.\\n\"Lots of people have different colloquial phrases. I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me the key question is making sure

You may even disagree with him on that.\"\\nThe comments weren't the first the president has made against Wray, with Trump also taking a swipe at his own FBI director last month.\\n\"'The FBI has no leadership,'\" Trump quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton as saying. \"'The Director is protecting the same gang that tried to overthrow the President through an illegal coup.'

I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me the key question is making sure

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.\"\\n

She remained there as the island attempted to recover, as well as worked with Waves for Water, a nonprofit organization that installed handmade water filters throughout Puerto Rico.\\nWilling to pick up where she left off, Lara came back to Los Angeles in 2018. And two weeks after that, Playboy called. She would go on to return to Puerto Rico once more for an opportunity of a lifetime.\\nLara spoke to Fox News about baring nearly all for the magazine, why she thinks the title of Playmate is inspiring, and how Hurricane Maria impacted her home.\\nAll I could think about was going home and just being with my family. I know that jeopardized my career because I was already established, signed and working in Los Angeles. But I took a chance to help my people to make them feel like we had each other's back no matter what. When I did decide to make the jump and move back home, I felt like I was doing the right thing. I knew it was going to affect my career, but I also knew in my heart that's what I was meant to do.\\n

It's not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this. \\nYahoo! News first reported on the retaliatory cyber strike. It came as the White House and Pentagon were also considering military strikes, but President Trump revealed last Friday that he called them off after learning up to 150 Iranians could be killed. \\n\"I stopped it, not ... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,\" he tweeted at the time.\\nYet the administration has pushed back on any suggestions that the decision to do so could embolden Iran further. On a visit to Israel Sunday, Trump's national security adviser had a blunt warning for the regime. \\n\"Neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,\" John Bolton said. \"No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East.\" \\nWith the U.S. having launched a cyberattack instead, tensions remain high even as Iranian forces were quiet over the weekend, officials told Fox News. \\nFor its part, Tehran claimed no successful cyberattack against its assets was carried out. \\nAmid these tensions, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Saudi Arabia--Iran's biggest rival--as part a hastily organized trip to meet Saudi King Salman.\\nThe drone shoot-down was only the latest flare-up in the region tied to Iran. \\nIn recent weeks, six oil tankers have been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran. The Trump administration is expected to announce more sanctions on Iran later Monday.\\nAt the Pentagon, new Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived for his first day on the job early Monday morning.  The former Army secretary took no questions.\\nWarships from the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group remain in the region, along with 70,000 U.S. troops including Air Force bombers and fighter jets. \\n

Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.\\nMore than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.\\nRebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.\\nMutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.\\n\"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,\" he said.\\n\"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,\" he said. \"I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.\"\\nThe idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.\\n\"We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,\" Redfield said.\\nMutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever. A dozen years ago, his foundation established a 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown of Kinshasa.\\nThe new spots were recorded in Kiswahili, French and Lingala. They talk about recognizing the early signs of Ebola, early treatment and prevention measures.\\n

Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \\n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \\nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.\"\\n

Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \\n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \\nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.\"\\n

Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \\n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \\nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two years.\"\\n

There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\\n

There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\\n

There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\\n

There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\\n

I think hesitation before using military action and asking how many casualties there are going to be on the other side is a good question.\"\\nThe \"Hardball\" host invoked the lives lost during the Iraq War and how those that died \"weren't the bad guys.\"\\n\"The fact he found out it was 150 or so people -- we went into Iraq, everybody said it was going to be quick and easy, it was going to be a slam dunk,\" Matthews elaborated.\\n\"We may have killed somewhere between 150,000 people and a million people, Iraqis, who were just there, they were just Iraqis, they weren't the bad guys. We only make that calculation now. It's time that -- I like the fact that the president asked up front to his NSC people: how many people will die if we take this step? I think it's good and I'm glad he did it.\"\\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that the president approved \"hard-hitting\" sanctions on Iran, hoping to specifically target Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates.\\n

We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.\"\\nClegg also said the ongoing backlash against Silicon Valley also created \"the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly ... Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\"\\nCarole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist whose work is credited with exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, dismissed Clegg's statements and retweeted the statements of others who believe that Facebook did play a role in influencing the Brexit referendum.\\n\"So Facebook spins propaganda. BBC platforms it. And LeaveEU amplifies it. A great morning's work, all. Well done. I honestly don't know where to start with this,\" Cadwalladr, who has called for an independent Robert Mueller-style probe into Brexit and written extensively on this topic, wrote on Twitter.\\nA Channel 4 investigation in May found that millionnaire Arron Banks spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the \"lavish lifestyle\" of Nigel Farage, a chief advocate of Brexit in the United Kingdom. Researchers and public figures have also said the Menlo Park, Calif., company hasn't been forthcoming enough with its own data, so academics can determine whether Russia played a role in Brexit.\\nDavid Lammy, a British lawmaker with the Labour Party, also questioned Clegg's comments.\\n\"Horse manure,\" Lammy wrote on Twitter. \"What about the disinformation spread by Russian state media, RT and Sputnik, on Facebook?\"\\nCollins chairs a U.K. parliamentary committee that has called for Facebook to be investigated by the country's privacy and competition regulators.\\nFacebook

There is some skill involved,\" he continued.\\nEdelman has started a Facebook group campaigning for the award, called \"Kentucky Fried Chicken deserves a Michelin Star.\"\\nAccording to Edelman's page, the chef believes the restaurant meets the criteria of a Michelin Star - one star is for \"a very good restaurant in its category\"; two stars, a restaurant has \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\"; for three, a restaurant must offer \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\"\\n\"On a basic level, we meet the criteria. If this street vendor can get the Michelin star why can't we?\" referring to a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, who has a Michelin Star and was featured on Netflix's \"Street Food\" series.\\n\"My KFC is the most remote KFC in the world and that's what sets me apart. I know people make a journey to come to my restaurant. I know that my team put their heart into making the best KFC they can make,\" he added to Metro.\\nEdelman thinks his franchise qualifies for both two and three stars, noting that the closest town from his KFC is 373 miles away, and people drive hours just to buy buckets of his fried chicken.\\n\"We have people who come to our KFC from 500km (310 miles) or 1000km (621 miles) away and they will expressly come in with the full intent to buy a bucket of KFC chicken while they are in town,\" he said to Metro.\\nEdelman, who started as a cook for KFC back in high school 20 years ago, has owned his franchise for seven.\\n\"I think that puts us in a unique position - excellent cooking. If there was only one KFC in the world, regardless of mine or another, it would be regarded as excellent cooking so that's where I'm going with it,\" he said to Metro.\\n\"Good food is for everyone,\" he added. \"Good food is not just meant to be for fine dining. So I thought, 'Bucket, why not give it a go.'\"\\n

Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.\\n\"Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,\" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. \"We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.\"\\nThe lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.\\n\"Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,\" she said.\\nAccording to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he \"wasn't going to turn them in\" himself.\\n\"I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,\" she told police, according to Fox 13.\\nBut the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: \"So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?\"\\nPolice then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.\\nAn arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.\\nIrby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.\\n\"Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,\" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. \"In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.\"\\nLakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to \"safeguard every citizen's rights.\\n\"When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,\" he said.\\nFox News' Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.\\n

Anna Eskamani come after Courtney Irby was released from custody late last week. Irby, 32, was arrested on June 15 after showing up to the Lakeland Police Department with guns belonging to her husband, Joseph Irby, just one day after he was detained on a domestic battery charge for allegedly trying to run her over. She now faces charges of armed burglary and grand theft.\\n\"Ms. Irby was seeking help from the Lakeland Police Department and taking action to protect herself and her children,\" Eskamani, a Democrat, said in the letter to Polk County State Attorney Brian Haas. \"We should be outraged by her arrest, and I am requesting that your office not prosecute her.\"\\nThe lawmaker said public officials should be creating an environment where victims of abuse can ask for help.\\n\"Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,\" she said.\\nAccording to police, Irby admitted to entering her husband's apartment without permission and taking the guns over fears he \"wasn't going to turn them in\" himself.\\n\"I did not even know where the guns were located. I had to search around the apartment for them, so I could bring them to you,\" she told police, according to Fox 13.\\nBut the officer that spoke to Irby reportedly responded: \"So, are you telling me you committed an armed burglary?\"\\nPolice then contacted Irby's husband, who was being held at the Polk County Jail for the previous day's incident, and he informed officers that he wanted to file charges against his wife, according to WKMG.\\nAn arrest affidavit revealed the couple had finished a divorce hearing on June 14 when they got into an argument. While trying to leave the courthouse, Irby's vehicle was allegedly rear-ended by her husband, who was attempting to run her off the road while she was on the phone with police.\\nIrby's arrest has sparked a public outcry - and Eskamani hasn't been the only one to speak out.\\n\"Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,\" tweeted Andrew Warren, a State Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County. \"In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors--not arrest them.\"\\nLakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia, in an interview with WFLA, said his department has to \"safeguard every citizen's rights.\\n\"When a case is brought to us, we have to look at all sides of the cases and come to the fairest conclusion we can for everyone involved,\" he said.\\nFox News' Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.\\n

However, the former foreign secretary and London mayor has spoken to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, defending his Brexit plans and decision not to speak about the widely reported row between himself and his partner Carrie Symonds.\\nHe said he did not believe \"for a moment\" that the UK would leave the EU without a deal, although he was willing for it to happen if necessary. Mr Johnson also said the EU would have to co-operate to avoid a hard Irish border.\\nOn his personal life, he refused to describe what had happened with Ms Symonds in the early hours of last Friday, saying: \"I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones.\"\\nThe BBC looks at Mr Johnson's track record in politics and that of fellow leadership contender Jeremy Hunt.\\nPlus, find out more about the Tory members choosing between them.\\nThe latest royal accounts show that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home - Frogmore Cottage in Windsor - was renovated with PS2.4m of taxpayers' money.

Her parents, Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who have campaigned for changes to the law, said they were \"delighted\". \"Natasha's Law\" is set to come into force in England and Northern Ireland by summer 2021.\\nThe BBC looks at the effects of severe allergic reactions,\\nIn the hills above Bergen, surrounded by tall pine trees, large icicles hanging from the branches, we are back on the trail of the Isdal Woman. This is the cold and remote location at the centre of a mystery which has puzzled Norway for half a century.\\nThere are so many strange details. Why was she here, seemingly alone, and unprepared for a freezing night in the wilderness? Why did she have multiple identities? Was she a spy? If so, who was she working for?\\nHer suitcases contained a coded note as well as disguises, and she swapped hotel rooms more than once. There was a mysterious meeting, it seems, with a naval officer. And why did the police shut down the case within just a few weeks, despite the many unanswered questions? Did someone want things hushed up?\\nRead the full story\\nBoris Johnson once again features on several front pages.

However, his latest barb targets four of the president's children.\\nLopez took to Instagram on Sunday to share a meme showing Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr. alongside their mother, Czech-born Ivana. In a lower panel, it shows First Lady Melania Trump with Barron. All those pictures have sombreros photoshopped on their heads. Text labels the children as \"anchor baby\" and the mothers as \"immigrant.\"\\n\"Uh , @icegov ' if your listening ' you can find these immigrants at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave - Signed Enrique Enpanada the third,\" Lopez captioned the meme.\\n\"Anchor baby\" is a term often used to describe a child granted birthright citizenship in the United States. According to the 14th Amendment, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\\nTrump has previously proposed ending that status, prompting many like Lopez to note that his children were born to immigrant mothers. However, According to The Associated Press, Trump is the kids' father, and a citizen of the United States, meaning birthright citizenship could be taken away and they would still be allowed to stay because their dad is a citizen.\\nIn addition, Ivana became a citizen in 1988 and Melania in 2006.\\nThe post was an effort to highlight the 58-year-old comedian's opinions on migrant children being detained at the border. Lopez was asked by TMZ if he thought it was appropriate to make his point about the president's policies by using his youngest kid, Barron.\\n\"Is it fair to put kids in cages? They're kids!\" Lopez shot back.\\n

Daniel Mederos of the Nashua Police Department told the Associated Press that Officer Michael Kekejian was conducting a stop on Sunday when 24-year-old Oscar Alicea hopped into his car.\\nKekejian leaped into the driver's seat on top of Alicea and ordered him out of the vehicle, only for the suspect to begin driving away with the door open. The officer and the suspect fought as the cruiser struck a fence and porch.\\nPolice say Alicea bit the officer at one point during the struggle, which they said \"recklessly placed several pedestrians in the area as well as Officer Kekejian in danger.\"\\nThe two managed to drive around an intersection before hitting a park bench and coming to a stop.\\nAuthorities say Kekejian was treated at a hospital and released after taking Alicea into custody.\\nWHDH reported that Alicea faces multiple felony charges, including reckless conduct, theft of a motor vehicle, assault on a

He called the confrontation between Callaway, Vargas and Newsday reporter Tim Healey \"regrettable on many levels.\"\\n\"I think frustrations were high,\" Van Wagenen said of Callaway. \"And, I think that he understands that from a leadership position, that we can't lose control and that he knows that that's not something that should have happened, and it's certainly not something that he intends to have happen again.\"\\nCallaway repeatedly called Healey a \"motherf---er\" after the reporter told the manager that he would \"see you tomorrow\" in the wake of the Mets 5-3 loss at Wrigley Field. Vargas told Healey that he would \"knock you the f--- out, bro\" and approached the reporter before he was restrained by pitcher Noah Syndergaard and outfielder Carlos Gomez.\\nIn a story published by Newsday Sunday night, Healey said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had called him to apologize.\\n\"He stressed the fact that I should feel comfortable being able to do my job at the ballpark and that moving forward, there's no reason for me to feel uncomfortable,\" Healey told the paper. \"I appreciated that sentiment from him, absolutely.\"\\nThe Mets also issued a statement that read, in part: \"The Mets sincerely regret the incident that took place with one of our beat writers following today's [Sunday's] game in the clubhouse. We do not condone this type of behavior from any employee.\"\\n\"I think everybody deserves respect regardless of job title or role,\" Callaway said at his pregame news conference Monday, \"and I hope people can understand that this is a tough game played by passionate competitors and I hope moving forward that we can all do our jobs honestly, critically, and understand that other people are involved.\"\\nCallaway initially declined to apologize publicly for the incident, saying: \"I don't need to tell my side. That doesn't help me in any way. It was a misunderstanding, obviously. For things like that to happen, it's always a misunderstanding ... It's just something that happened and we have to move forward.\"\\nHowever, the Mets manager later called the media back into the clubhouse, where he informed them that he had apologized privately to Healey.\\n\"I regret the distraction it's caused to the team,\" Callaway said. \"It's something I'm not proud of, I'm not proud of the distraction. I'm not proud of what I did to Tim, so, for that, I'm definitely sorry.\"\\nVargas said Monday that the issue was \"an unfortunate distraction.\"\\n\"Tonight, we've got the Phillies to play. The team's addressed the situation, the organization's made a statement and that's really all there is to it,\" Vargas told reporters. \"So, thanks for taking your time, and we'll see you guys after the game.\"\\nThe Mets entered play Monday with a record of 37-41, nine games back of the National League East-leading Atlanta Braves. According to Van Wagenen, Callaway's status as manager was unchanged.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, filed legislation Monday that would take hundreds of millions of dollars from frozen Iranian bank accounts and use them to offset the cost of an American military drone that was shot down by Tehran last week.\\nThe proposal, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, would require the Trump administration to asses the cost of the drone, which was believed to be between $120 million and $220 million.\\nThe legislation was made public hours after President Trump signed an executive order restricting access by Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and senior military figures to financial resources and blocking their access to any financial assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the new sanctions mean the U.S. has \"literally locked up tens and tens of billions of dollars.\"\\nThe U.S. has said the Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz last week. Iran has claimed the aircraft was violating Iranian airspace and the country's naval commander has warned that Iranian forces would not hesitate to act again and shoot down more drones that violate Iranian airspace.\\nFox News also learned Monday that the U.S. military carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as Trump opted against carrying out plans for airstrikes. Sources told Fox News that U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the drone.\\nFox News also has learned Iran shut off some of its military radar sites around the time the U.S. was poised to launch retaliatory strikes. It was not clear if those radar sites were turned off by the cyberattack or if Iran shut them off deliberately in anticipation of this.\\nFox News' Guerin Hays, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated

Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.\\nMore than 2,200 people have been reported ill -- and about 1,500 have died -- since an Ebola outbreak was declared in August in eastern Congo. It is the second deadliest outbreak of the lethal virus, which jumps from person to person quickly through close contact with bodily fluids.\\nRebel attacks and community resistance have hurt Ebola response work in Congo. A World Health Organization doctor was killed in April, health centers have been attacked and armed groups have repeatedly threatened health workers. Because of safety concerns, the U.S. State Department last year ordered CDC disease specialists to stay out of the outbreak areas.\\nMutombo, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.\\n\"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict,\" he said.\\n\"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo,\" he said. \"I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health.\"\\nThe idea for the PSA was sparked in February when Mutombo, a member of the CDC Foundation's governing board who lives in Atlanta, was talking with Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director.\\n\"We are deeply appreciative of his interest to try to get accurate information to the community,\" Redfield said.\\nMutombo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, previously did public service announcements focused on polio and yellow fever.

Prosecutors are expected in the penalty phase to focus on Christensen's brutality, with the defense broaching mental health issues.\\nThe judge has said there will be a break of a week or more before the penalty phase, a sort of mini-trial that could last several weeks.\\nIllinois no longer has capital punishment, but he could be sentenced to death because he was convicted in federal court.\\nThe federal death-penalty case is the first in Illinois since the state struck capital punishment from its books on grounds that death-penalty processes were too error-prone. Some Illinois anti-death penalty activists criticized what they said was the government's imposition of a death-penalty case on a non-death penalty state.\\nThe defense began the trial with the rare admission that their client killed Zhang, but said they said they disagreed with prosecutors over how and why. The surprising strategy was a bid to start immediately trying to persuade jurors to spare Christensen's life.\\nJurors heard evidence that Christensen boasted he killed 12 others before killing Zhang, starting when the Stevens Point, Wisconsin native was 19 and still living in Wisconsin. He began his studies in Champaign at the university's prestigious doctoral program in physics in 2013.\\nHis lawyers said he made the claim about being a serial killer when he was drunk and that it was not true, but the FBI did not rule it out.\\nChristensen, now 29, lured Zhang into his car posing as an undercover officer when she was running late to sign the apartment lease on June 9, 2017. The muscular Christensen forced the 5-foot-4 Zhang into his apartment in Urbana, Champaign's sister city 140 miles southwest of Chicago, where he raped and killed her.\\nZhang was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, prosecutors said, adding Christensen -- who had fantasized about killing -- determined to kill someone that day and had been cruising in his car looking for a victim. Earlier, he approached a different young woman posing as an officer, but she refused to get in the car.\\nHe and his girlfriend, Terra Bullis, attended a vigil for Zhang on June 29, during which Bullis wore an FBI wire recording him detailing how he killed Zhang. As they left at night, she said she'd rather not call a ride-sharing service, telling him: \"My version of safer is walking at night with a serial killer.\" He responds: \"Yeah. That's me.\"\\nChristensen was arrested on June 30, 2017, his birthday.\\nChristensen sought help from mental-health counselors at the school for homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the months before Zhang vanished, according to his lawyers, who said his life was spinning out of control. In his first few semesters as a doctoral student, Christensen was making straight As but by late 2016, was getting Fs in all his classes.\\nThere are more than 5,000 Chinese among the 45,000 students attending the University of Illinois in Champaign, one of the largest such enrollments in the nation.\\nZhang had been in Illinois for just three months -- her only time living outside China. The daughter of working-class parents, she aspired to become a professor in crop sciences to help her family financially. Friends and family described her as caring and fun-loving.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n

He declined to give details but said Wells was happy that stick was back in the arena - where he had intended to be 39 years ago.\\n\"It's history,\" Walby said. \"To have an individual from St. Clair Shores be part of the 1980 hockey team was great.\"\\nEach team member received a stick autographed by the players and coach Herb Brooks. Similar sticks have sold for $290,000 in recent years, according to the Macomb Daily.\\nThe stick is being protected by the St. Clair Shores Police Department for the time being.\\nIt's unclear where the stick has been for all these years.\\nWells played 29 games for Team USA, scoring nine goals and seven assists.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n

Historians said she helped guide over 300 slaves to freedom and also served as a spy and a scout for the Union Army during the Civil War.\\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Louis Casiano and The Associated

The Salt Lake City Police Department said Lueck arrived at the airport on June 17 and ordered a Lyft ride to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake.\\nDoubt said she was last seen meeting an unknown person at the park. He declined to describe that person's gender, saying investigators did not know who it was. \\nDoubt said the Lyft driver who dropped off Lueck told investigators she did not seem in distress when she met the person at the park at around 3 a.m. The Lyft driver has been cleared as a potential suspect, police said.\\nLueck's parents said they last heard from her around 1 a.m. on June 17. They said their daughter texted them and told them her flight landed, but they haven't heard from her since.\\nLast Thursday, Lueck's family reported her missing.\\n\"Since being reported missing detectives attempted to locate her through her phone which has been turned off and those efforts remain unsuccessful,\" Doubt said on Monday. \\nHe added, \"Detectives have listed Mackenzie in the national database as missing and are exploring all avenues of investigative techniques including writing and serving various warrants, talking to friends and family and checking social media.\"\\nDoubt told reporters that investigators have been looking for Mackenzie since her family reported her missing. \\n\"Since we took the report on Thursday detectives have canvassed the area around Hatch Park multiple times to try and locate any video surveillance from businesses or from residences that may have captured anything,\" Doubt said. \"Detectives are also knocking on doors in the area of the park to rule out that anyone there may have had contact with Mackenzie or seen anything.\" \\nThe University of Utah released a statement on Monday saying it was cooperating with the investigation.\\n\"The University of Utah is deeply concerned about the well-being of Mackenzie \"Kenzie\" Lueck and her family,\" the statement said. \"The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return.\"\\nLueck has been described as 5 feet 6 inches and weighs around 120 pounds, with blonde hair and brown eyes.\\n\"Occasionally the police work a missing-person case where the person does not want to have contact with family or friends. If that is the case, Mackenzie, we are asking you to please reach out to either the Salt Lake City Police Department or a law enforcement agency where you are at,\" Doubt said. \"We just want to make sure you are safe and we will respect your wishes.\"\\nAnyone with information on Lueck's disappearance was urged to contact the Salt Lake City Police Department.\\nFox News' Nicole Darrah and The

The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.\\nTRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS\\nThe judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\\n\"We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,\" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.\\nShe said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, \"abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.\"\\nRepublican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.\\n\"We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,\" he said in a statement.\\nThe fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.\\nThe state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three \"failed abortions\" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.\\nMissouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nThe number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n

Mexican security forces previously have detained migrants traveling within Mexico but had not stopped them from crossing into the United States.\\n\"Given that migration is not a crime but rather an administrative violation, we simply detain them and turn them over to the [Mexican immigration] authorities,\" said Sandoval, as the AFP news agency reported.\\nMexican officials also said Monday that the border city of Nuevo Laredo was expected to start receiving migrants returned from the United States as early as this week. Under the terms of an agreement between Washington and Mexico City to expand the so-called \"remain in Mexico\" program, asylum seekers are to wait on the Mexican side of the border while their claims make their way through U.S. courts.\\nNuevo Laredo could receive up to 150-200 asylum seekers daily beginning Friday, though local officials said Mexico's government has not yet confirmed how many the city will be receiving.\\nPrevious rollouts of the program at two points along the California-Mexico border and at Ciudad Juarez-El Paso on the Texas border began in small numbers and gradually increased.\\n\"It is a humanitarian issue that we will be attending to within the measure of our capacities,\" Nuevo Laredo Mayor Enrique Rivas told The Associated Press. \"The federal government must take responsibility for being the ones who took this decision (to accept the program's expansion). We will continue knocking on doors to find resources. The municipal government is overwhelmed.\"\\nRivas and Deputy Mayor Raul Cardenas Thomae said Nuevo Laredo's shelters already have been overflowing with some 3,000 migrants. The city was studying the possibility of opening another shelter to accommodate the returnees, they said.\\nThomae said Nuevo Laredo would be receiving those returned across a stretch of border about 260 miles long from Roma, Texas, to Ciudad Acuna, in the state of Coahuila.\\nThere have been more than 14,000 returns by migrants to Mexico under the program since it launched in January, according to the most recent figures available from the Mexican government.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n

The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic's abortion license.\\nTRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS\\nThe judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\\n\"We will continue this fight in the Administrative Hearing Commission, and we won't stop until every person can access the care they need when and where they need it,\" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at Reproductive Health Services at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.\\nShe said in a statement that if the commission doesn't act by Friday, \"abortion access in the state of Missouri will be gone.\"\\nRepublican Gov. Mike Parson's spokesman Steele Shippy said the judge's ruling affirms the state's contention that the licensing dispute should be heard by the commission.\\n\"We look forward to trying the merits of this case in front of the AHC in our ongoing effort to ensure Planned Parenthood is following our state's health laws, which are necessary to protect women's safety,\" he said in a statement.\\nThe fate of the clinic has drawn national attention because Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide, without a functioning abortion clinic if it closes. The battle also comes as abortion rights supporters raise concerns that conservative-led states are attempting to end abortion through tough new laws and tighter regulation.\\nThe state has said concerns about the clinic arose from inspections in March. Among the problems Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services investigators have cited were three \"failed abortions\" requiring additional surgeries and another that led to life-threatening complications for the mother, The Associated Press reported last week, citing a now-sealed court filing.\\nMissouri is among several conservative states, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, to pass new restrictions on abortions in the hope that the high court will eventually overturn Roe v. Wade.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nThe number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to health department data.\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \\n

The situation became increasingly dire last week after Tehran admitted to downing a $100 million U.S. Navy drone.\\nAbbas Mousavi took to Twitter to call out President Trump's latest decision to impose additional sanctions and said the sanctions means \"closing channel of diplomacy forever,\" according to Reuters. \\n\"Trump's desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security,\" the tweet read.\\nJohn Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, later said the U.S. open to negotiations, all Iran needs to do is \"walk through that open door.\" It was unclear if his response was in connection to Mousavi's tweet.\\nTrump, for his part, has been largely credited for his show of prudence while dealing with a hostile country. Trump appears hesitant to enter another hot war in the region but said Monday that his \"restraint\" is not limitless.\\nTrump said the sanctions \"will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader's office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions \"lock up literally billions of dollars more of assets.\"\\nFox News has confirmed that the U.S. military also carried out a cyberattack against Iran last Thursday even as the president nixed plans for airstrikes in response to the downing of an American drone.\\nSources said U.S. Cyber Command launched the cyberattack targeting the Iranian intelligence and radar installations used to down the U.S. Navy drone last week.\\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report\\n

By contrast, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., assessed the situation thus: \"I think we're further apart.\"\\nThe varying interpretations marked an ominous restart to the negotiations. Notice we said restart to the negotiations. That's because talks have been in purgatory for weeks.\\nJust before the confab, one senior source close to the talks expressed confidence.\\n\"We're going to get it done,\" said the source, who asked not to be identified. \"We have to.\"\\nThe big concern for Republicans is that failure to raise the spending caps hits the military extraordinarily hard and makes it a challenge to reach an accord on any of the spending bills.\\n\"You have to raise the caps. That would undercut everything the President has tried to do with the military,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\\nCongressional leaders and key appropriators also huddled in mid-May with Mulvaney, Mnuchin and others. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested the sides were close to an agreement then.\\n\"Our hope is to make a deal before the day is over,\" McConnell said last month.\\nThen came the best sign that things were going well. Three hours after one meeting, the administration team returned to the Capitol for a matinee round of negotiations. Things like that don't usually happen in Washington unless the talks are getting somewhere. Another positive sign was that people were mum. But the day finished with no deal, despite McConnell's optimism.\\nEverything spilled into the ditch the following day. Congressional Democratic leaders were scheduled to visit the White House to meet with the President on infrastructure. President Trump and top lawmakers appeared to have forged an infrastructure pact earlier in the spring. But then Trump browbeat Pelosi for accusing him of a \"cover-up\" and abruptly adjourned the council before it could really get started.\\nGranted, the infrastructure discussions were on a separate track from the spending caps-debt ceiling negotiations. But everything in Washington hinges on relationships and the political climate. If you're not getting along on infrastructure or House Democratic investigations of the Trump Administration, it's doubtful you can miraculously pivot, sing \"Kumbaya\" and produce a fiscal pact on spending and the debt limit.\\nSo, no one met again until last week. And the only thing that could be agreed on was that all parties were in disagreement.\\n\"In the spirit of cooperation, our first priority is to raise the debt ceiling,\" said Mnuchin outside the Speaker's Office last week. \"Everyone agreed we would not make the debt ceiling subject to spending.\"\\nStanding next to Mnuchin, Mulvaney declared that the administration scored a win in the meeting: a change in Pelosi's position on the sequencing of the talks.\\nPelosi suggested a week-and-a-half ago that an agreement to lift mandatory spending caps, known as sequestration, was her primary demand.\\n\"When we lift the caps, then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling. But that would have to come second or simultaneous. But not before lifting the caps,\" Pelosi said.\\nThe Speaker took issue with Mulvaney's representations.\\n\"Do we have to waste time on Mick Mulvaney's characterization of my remarks?\" retorted an agitated Pelosi. \"Mulvaney's one of the people who shut down government because they didn't want to lift the debt ceiling. And so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever.\"\\nThat conflates two issues. As a Republican Congressman from South Carolina, Mulvaney opposed some bills to fund the government. He voted against a major package in 2011 to raise the debt ceiling and create the very spending caps which negotiators are now trying to terminate. The latter package had nothing to do with keeping the government open.\\nMulvaney remains central to the talks. But Pelosi isn't the only Democratic leader who has reservations about the President's Acting Chief of Staff.\\n\"I think Mulvaney does not want a deal. I think that's the biggest problem,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.\\nOne senior source familiar with the discussions tells Fox that Mulvaney \"p---ed everybody off\" during last week's meeting. Some Democratic negotiators told Mnuchin they'd prefer to deal with him instead - and asked he leave Mulvaney back at the White House.\\nHowever, if there is no agreement on the spending caps, the administration wants a year-long Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the government. By its nature, CRs simply renew current funding at existing levels. There would also be a one-year suspension of the debt ceiling. Democrats oppose the proposal.\\nAfter the meeting in the Speaker's Office, Mulvaney accused Democrats of trying to extort additional money for non-defense programs. The military figure always dwarfs the non-defense number, since the Pentagon receives more than half of all discretionary dollars allotted by Congress these days. President Trump requested $750 billion for the military. Democrats don't oppose increasing defense spending - if they secure a significant increase for everything else.\\n\"Everybody is trying to raise the caps,\" said Mulvaney.\\nAfter the meeting on Capitol Hill, Mulvaney argued that Democrats wanted to spend $639 billion on non-defense programs. Now it's $647 billion.\\n\"So you tell me if things are moving in the right direction,\" said Mulvaney.\\nThe Democratic number did grow. But Democrats gave themselves the agility to increase the size of the non-defense pie in a budget resolution the House \"deemed\" to be approved earlier this year. The additional $8 billion is for the Census and for IRS enforcement efforts. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., announced the hike in a letter to Pelosi last week.\\nHoyer noted that Democrats were ready to give Republicans $733 billion for defense and suggested that Mulvaney and other Republicans were still pushing for tens of billions of additional dollars for a special defense spending fund: \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" or \"OCO.\" OCO is real money which goes to the Pentagon. But it doesn't count against the spending caps.\\n\"That's fiscally totally irresponsible and a game,\" said Hoyer. \"[Mulvaney] wants maximum pressure in September to squeeze down as hard as he can on non-defense discretionary spending.\"\\nThe lack of progress in the negotiations is a problem. A failure to raise the debt ceiling later this summer could spark a market shock. Lawmakers are still stung from what unfolded in 2011 as Congress and the Obama Administration struggled to lift the debt limit.\\nWhen asked what the administration wants in a debt ceiling increase, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland replied \"as long as we can get. As early as we can get.\"\\nBut the hour is growing late. In fact, some argue that the window for a caps agreement is closed altogether. The debt ceiling issue could prove so all-consuming that there's no bandwidth for a caps package. There was a rush to get a deal before the Senate began writing its annual spending measures. Senate Republicans view the four appropriations bills the House approved last week - and the batch on tap for this week - as \"messaging\" bills. They won't go anywhere. No Republicans voted for the appropriations measure last week.\\nOne source told Fox each side is now just trying to decide where the other is willing to land.\\nRepublicans are leery of another government shutdown. They're afraid that last winter's 35-day standoff left voters believing Trump can't govern. Another shutdown could be devastating. One thing is for certain: another government shutdown would make the last one look like choir practice. That's why GOPers are pushing a one-year government funding package. It's the lesser of two evils.\\nThe downside is that a CR would only spend $716 billion on defense. Surprisingly, GOP sources say the president seems okay with that. One source noted that with no Defense Secretary, there's nobody at the White House advocating for the Pentagon. So, the defense number could dwindle. Democrats oppose the one-year CR. But they may also prefer a lesser of two evils. That would involve holding the line on defense spending - even if they don't lock in increases elsewhere.\\nSo this is all stalled now. It's amazing to remember that McConnell thought the sides could wrap this up weeks ago. That's why the only thing certain in Washington is uncertainty.\\n\n",

This has been a priority of mine and I'm pleased to share that it is up and running!\"\\nThe new WinRed site appears to be the GOP's response to the Democrats' grassroots donation juggernaut ActBlue, which touts it's brought in more than $174 million in the first fundraising quarter of this year.\\nWhile the president has greatly outraised his 2020 Democratic challengers -- and the RNC has a large advantage in fundraising over the Democratic National Committee -- Democrats still have had the edge in online small-dollar donations.\\nThat advantage was a contributing factor in their 2018 midterm election successes, when the Democrats convincingly took back control of the House of Representatives and picked up seven gubernatorial seats.\\nThe launch of WinRed marks the first time the GOP has had a single website for all of its candidates, from the president to down-ballot races.\\nWinRed is part of \"The Trump Make America Great Again Committee,\" known by the acronym TMAGAC. The website indicates that it's \"a joint fundraising committee composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ('DJTP') and the Republican National Committee ('RNC').\"\\nThe president's campaign brand has been raking in big bucks all year, a reality underscored by last week's rally officially launching his re-election campaign. Together with joint-fundraising committees, the campaign and party reported raising a whopping $24.8 million in less than 24 hours surrounding the Orlando rally launch.\\nA Trump campaign official told Fox News last week that the campaign raised more than $14 million, and that the joint-fundraising committees raised more than $10 million.\\n

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are trying to outdo each other with their campaign promises, according to Chris Stirewalt.\\nSanders and Warren are both staking their claim in the progressive wing of the 2020 primary field, and beginning to cause concern among party brass, Stirewalt said Monday on \"The Daily Briefing.\"\\n\"By the time Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are done, they will be promising each and every American a new Buick LaCrosse in their parking lot,\" the Fox News politics editor claimed.\\n\"They are in this lunatic derby. This is why Democratic leaders are rightly afraid of what's going on. Because, if Sanders - who is now promising to forgive the student loans of everybody, basically, 'throw in another trillion dollars,' - if either Sanders or Warren get the nomination, there is a reality that Democrats won't just miss out on taking the White House back, but they could get cleaned out in the Senate.\"\\nStirewalt claimed there is a danger the two candidates' platforms could cause Democrats to also lose control of the House.\\n\"This stuff is way outside the mainstream,\" he claimed. \"That's what Democrats are afraid of.\"\\nDuring a speech Saturday at Clinton College in Rock Hill, S.C., Sanders claimed graduates are put in an \"absurd position of having to pay that debt off for decades.\"\\n\"Some of those people, they can't afford to get married,\" he said, in a clip played by host Dana Perino.\\n\"They can afford to have kids. They can't afford to buy their own home.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the \"Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.\"\\nThe source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\\n\"He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told Fox News. \"He has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\\nOn Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.\\nTom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on \"Fox & Friends\" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.\\n\"You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,\" Homan said. \"He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.\"\\nHe noted that the leaked story \"gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets\" and added: \"This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\\nThe source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\\n\"To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,\" the source told Fox News, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.\"\\nSources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.\\nRepresentatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.\\nFollowing the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that \"due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\"\\nICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants \"who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.\"\\nBy Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.\\nThe change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would \"begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\"\\nOn Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would \"give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.\"\\nHe added: \"I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.\"\\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \\n

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the \"Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.\"\\nThe source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\\n\"He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told Fox News. \"He has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\\nOn Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.\\nTom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on \"Fox & Friends\" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.\\n\"You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,\" Homan said. \"He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.\"\\nHe noted that the leaked story \"gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets\" and added: \"This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\\nThe source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\\n\"To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,\" the source told Fox News, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.\"\\nSources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.\\nRepresentatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.\\nFollowing the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that \"due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\"\\nICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants \"who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.\"\\nBy Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.\\nThe change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would \"begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\"\\nOn Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would \"give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.\"\\nHe added: \"I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.\"\\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \\n

Bernie Sanders, I-VT, debuted his plan Monday to tackle the student loan crisis by proposing to eliminate the whopping $1.6 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street.\\n\"This proposal will make it possible for every person in America to get a college education no matter what their financial situation,\" Sanders said. \"We will make a full and complete education a fundamental right.\"\\nThe freshman congresswoman expressed her support for the proposed legislation.\\n\"I will be completely honest,\" Ocasio-Cortez began.\\n\"I will disclose my personal stake in this fight because I have student loans too. And I think it's so funny that a year ago, I was waiting tables at a restaurant and it was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt.\\n\"So that should tell you everything about the state of this economy and the state of quality of life for working people.\"\\nShe continued, \"In order for me to get a chance to have health care, in order for me to get a chance to pay off my student loans, I had to do something that was nearly impossible and I don't think that is the bar through which a person should be able to access education, health care, and a bevy of other things that should be considered human rights.\"\\n

Nelson Candelario, a Marine defense attorney representing Gallagher. \\n\"That's true,\" Sheridan replied.\\n\"As far as you can see, there is no blood on his hands?\" Candelario asked, displaying a photo of Gallagher at the scene. \"As far as I can see,\" the pathologist said.\\n\"Your testimony here is built on possibilities and maybes,\" Candelario said, pointing out that there was no autopsy or physical evidence.\\nGallagher's trial has drawn national attention and even a response from President Trump. \\nIts most dramatic moment came last week when a SEAL Team Seven medic-- testifying under an immunity agreement--  told the court that he held his \"thumb over his TT tube\" until the ISIS teen \"quit breathing.\" He earlier claimed that he saw Gallagher stab the boy in his neck.\\nGallagher, 39,  served nine months in prison while he awaited trial in the fatal stabbing of the 15-year old ISIS fighter in Iraq. He has also been accused of shooting two civilians in the same year, and opening fire on crowds, all claims he has denied.\\nInvestigators allege that, while the teen was receiving medical treatment from SEAL medics, Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in his neck and side with a knife, killing him. Then, they say, he posed for photographs with the fighter's body, holding his head in one hand and his blade in the other.\\nThose allegations have been called into question by top Iraqi military officials.\\nIn a tense exchange later in the day, Gallagher's lead defense attorney attacked an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for \"dragging\" Gallagher's children--8 and 18 at the time-- to the street during a raid of Gallagher's home in 2018.\\n\"They were taken out of the house in their underwear,\" charged attorney Timothy Parlatore. \"Yes, sir,\" said NCIS Special Agent James Frank. The agent cited \"standard protocol,\" explaining that investigators clear a house before searching it.\\nThe trial resumes Tuesday with the lead NCIS investigator on the stand. Special Agent Joseph Warpinski oversaw the investigation into the alleged stabbing and has been accused of misconduct by defense attorneys.\\n\"This is the guy who put his own career ambition ahead of his sworn duty as a law enforcement officer,\" Parlatore told reporters after court on Friday. \"He's going to have to answer for a lot of the misdeeds that he has committed over this past two

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the \"Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.\"\\nThe source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April--prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello's departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up--and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.\\n\"He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,\" the source told Fox News. \"He has been fighting this operation since its inception.\"\\nOn Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.\\nTom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on \"Fox & Friends\" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.\\n\"You've got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,\" Homan said. \"He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that's his position, then he's on the wrong side of this issue.\"\\nHe noted that the leaked story \"gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets\" and added: \"This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.\"\\nThe source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.\\n\"To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger--that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,\" the source told Fox News, noting that \"you can't go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.\"\\nSources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.\\nRepresentatives for DHS and ICE have not responded to Fox News' request for comment on the allegations against McAleenan.\\nFollowing the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that \"due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\"\\nICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants \"who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.\"\\nBy Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.\\nThe change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would \"begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\"\\nOn Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" Morgan said the postponement of the raids would \"give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.\"\\nHe added: \"I've got the green light to anyone that's here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.\"\\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \\n

Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\\nConnecticut federal prosecutor John Durham is looking closely at the intelligence community's activity in late 2016 and early 2017, the House Freedom Caucus chairman claimed on \"Hannity.\"\\n\"I can tell you that John Durham and Attorney General Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,\" he said.\\n\"They are including in part of their surveillance - really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.\"\\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who joined Meadows on \"Hannity,\" added he agreed with the North Carolina lawmaker and that a previous report by the Justice Department's inspector general was fruitful.\\n\"The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation,\" he said. \"They have told us this is broader than just the FBI - they're going to look at all of this.\\n\"First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,\" Jordan said, referring to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz.\\n\"Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.\"\\nAs part of its ongoing \"multifaceted\" and \"broad\" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several \"non-governmental organizations and individuals.\"\\nAdditionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, led by Durham, was looking into the involvement of \"foreign intelligence services.\"\\nFormer Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely \"CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel\" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to \"seduce him\" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.\\nThe information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation.\\nThe letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.\\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.\\n

And, to also draw a contrast with each other,\" Brazile said.\\nClimate change is expected to be one point of difference among the Democratic hopefuls, with most of the frontrunners having released an environmental or \"green\" plan to tackle the issue.\\nHowever, the issue of college debt is expected to be a hot topic as well, with many of the contenders having pushed plans to get rid of or reduce the figures.\\nIn May, 2020 hopeful Julian Castro unveiled a comprehensive education plan that calls for eliminating tuition at public colleges as well as delaying student loan payments until a degree begins to pay off for borrowers.\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed to raise taxes with more than $50 million dollars in assets, pay off student loans and make college tuition-free, create government-funded child care centers and fight the opioid crisis, among other things.\\nOn Monday morning in front of the Capitol's steps, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., launched his college affordability plan, announcing legislation to achieve free tuition for public colleges and to forgive all student loan debt.\\nThat's $1.6 trillion dollars covering 45 million Americans.\\nThe Democratic socialist candidate said the money needed to fund such a program could be raised by a tax on Wall Street.\\n\"Our proposal which costs two point two trillion over 10 years will be fully paid for by a tax on Wall Street speculation similar to what exists in dozens of countries around the world,\" Sanders said. \"The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.\"\\nRep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., were among those who spoke on behalf of the legislation.\\nAn impassioned Ocasio-Cortez told reporters: \"What we tell 17 year-olds all the time is that you are not old enough or responsible enough to drink. You are not old enough or responsible enough to vote. You are not old enough or responsible enough to serve in our military. But, you are old enough and responsible enough to take on a quarter million dollars' worth of debt and that is wrong.\"\\n\"It was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,\" the New Yorker said.\\nOn \"America's Newsroom,\" Brazile said Americans \"want to hear solutions\" to the issue.\"45 million Americans have enormous college debt. The question is, will Bernie's proposal which calls for 0.5 percent on stock transactions and 0.1 percent on bond transactions? Bernie Sanders intends to pay for it by taxing those transactions...Elizabeth Warren's proposal is a little different in terms of...it calls for $750 billion,\" Brazile noted.\\n\"There's no question that someone has to pay for it, but 45 million Americans are suffering right now. They want to hear solutions.\"\\n

I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.\"\\nRegarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.\\nKavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was \"keen\" to see his anti-Trump materials \"come to light\" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.\\nOn that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be \"clearly obstructing our investigation.\"\\nNunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.\\n\"I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,\" he said.\\n\"The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians.\"\\n

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Berrnie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are four of the five highest-polling candidates in recent national and early-voting state polling. They will appear on the second night. The fifth, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will appear on stage with another crowd of candidates the first night.\\nDocumentary producer Jody Avirgan tweeted Monday that some feel \"candidates in the first debate are at a disadvantage because they only get one news cycle before the next night\" but he disagrees because \"news cycle lasts more than a day\" and Trump could do something himself to distract.\\nThe MSNBC host responded Monday, taking it a step further and claiming the president could launch an attack simply to distract from the 2020 Democratic hopefuls.\\n\"I swear I have a fear he launches some kind of military strike *during one of the debates,*\" Hayes tweeted.\\nAvirgan fired back, \"I've had the same thought, didn't want to actually commit it to writing.\"\\nHayes' NBC is the DNC's media partner for the first round of debates, which include far-left pundit Rachel Maddow serving as a moderator.\\nIt's hardly the first time Hayes has made outlandish comments on social media to defend or protect lefty leaders. Just last week, the Auschwitz Memorial responded to Hayes after he defended divisive comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who recently compared U.S. border facilities to concentration camps.\\nHayes responded to a tweet by Rep. Liz Cheney, which mocked Ocasio-Cortez for evoking the extermination of six million Jewish people during the Holocaust to make a point about the treatment of migrants.\\n\"If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis,\" Hayes tweeted in an attempt to defend Ocasio-Cortez.\\nBut the verified twitter account of the Auschwitz Memorial took notice and suggested the MSNBC host educate himself about the tragic events that took place at the concentration camp.\\n\"@chrislhayes Please consider following @AuschwitzMuseum where everyday we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of #Auschwitz,\" the memorial tweeted.\\nFox

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, claimed on Monday that it was \"literally easier\" for her to win her historic election as the youngest lawmaker on Capitol Hill than to pay off her student loan debt.\\nThe freshman New Yorker, who now a $170,000 salary as a congresswoman after previously working as a bartender, made the surprising remark after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, debuted his plan Monday to tackle the student loan crisis by proposing to eliminate the whopping $1.6 trillion in student debt by taxing Wall Street.\\n\"This proposal will make it possible for every person in America to get a college education no matter what their financial situation,\" Sanders said. \"We will make a full and complete education a fundamental right.\"\\nThe freshman congresswoman expressed her support for the proposed legislation.\\n\"I will be completely honest,\" Ocasio-Cortez began.\\n\"I will disclose my personal stake in this fight because I have student loans too. And I think it's so funny that a year ago, I was waiting tables at a restaurant and it was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt.\\n\"So that should tell you everything about the state of this economy and the state of quality of life for working people.\"\\nShe continued, \"In order for me to get a chance to have health care, in order for me to get a chance to pay off my student loans, I had to do something that was nearly impossible and I don't think that is the bar through which a person should be able to access education, health care, and a bevy of other things that should be considered human rights.\"\\n

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n</td>\n",

That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety.

This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation.

To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls.

Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey.

Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better.

It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer.

       "      <td>How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n</td>\n",

The answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish's wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!,\" which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in the Square Theater.\\n\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" is the title and the opening line of this familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n  Daniel         Fish       \n",

But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn't cushioned by the expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.\\nAs embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to implode. There's the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.\\nDoing his best to project a confidence he doesn't entirely feel, to the accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a little dangerous.\\nHe's a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he's so proud to belong to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.\\nMaking his Broadway debut as a director, Mr. Fish has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is \"Oklahoma!\" for an era in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly skeptical eyes.\\nSuch a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of Oscar Hammerstein II's original book and lyrics. This isn't an act of plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a figure of disturbing -- and exciting -- depth and complexity.\\nMr. Fish's version isn't the first \"Oklahoma!\" to elicit the shadows from within the play's sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman's interpretation for London's National Theater of nearly two decades ago, while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic elements.\\nBut this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips \"Oklahoma!\" down to its skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in which the show (based on Lynn Riggs's \"Green Grow the Lilacs\") takes place.\\nLaura Jellinek's set suggests a small-town community center that might double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored lights -- and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It's made clear that we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate lighting designer.)\\nThere's chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the audience's consumption at intermission. A seven-member hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they play have been reimagined -- by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger Daniel Kluger -- with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of country and western ballads.\\nThe cast members -- wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese Wadden did the costumes) -- are just plain folks. Singing with conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this together.\\nThough the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism, Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill).\\nOh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly, well, weird handyman who's sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that's guaranteed to haunt your nightmares.\\nThese people -- in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast -- intersect much as they usually do in \"Oklahoma!\" They court and spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.\\nMs. Stroker's boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis's deliciously dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative Aunt Eller.\\nBut there's an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms. Jones's affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and terror.\\nThat her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud's dank hovel of a home. Curly sings \"Pore Jud,\" in which he teasingly imagines his rival's funeral with an ominous breathiness.\\nThe scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white of the two men face to face. And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this gun-toting universe, melt altogether.\\nI first saw Mr. Fish's \"Oklahoma!\" at Bard College in 2015, and again at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last year. It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting better. The performances are looser and bigger; they're Broadway-size now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.\\nAt the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good. In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking conclusion -- the scene that takes the most liberties with the original. In its carefully retooled rendering, it's disturbing for all the right reasons.\\nThe other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced. It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads \"Dream Baby Dream.\"\\nWhat she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by Agnes de Mille, the show's legendary original choreographer. But on its own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.\\nAs she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling beneath the surface here.\\nShe's as stimulating and frightening -- and as fresh -- as last night's fever dream. So is this astonishing show.\\n  Terese         Wadden     \n",
